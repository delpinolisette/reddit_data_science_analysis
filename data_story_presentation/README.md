## Presentation of your data story for COMM318 _Stories from data_ Final Project

The data story presentation can be read as a PDF (see `data_story.pdf`), as if it were a printed magazine article. The "(source)" links are not highlighted in the pdf, but they are hyperlinks, so you can still click on them. 

The nicer way to read it is on GitHub, as a rendered markdown file. The difference is that you can read `data_story.md` from any mobile device, including your phone if you download the Github app. 

Enjoy! I worked hard on this data story, and I thought the results were from my data analysis were interesting.
