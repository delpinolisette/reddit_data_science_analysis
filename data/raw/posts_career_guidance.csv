0,Anyone else depressed?,1484,iuq5bq,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/iuq5bq/anyone_else_depressed/,315,"Anyone else in their mid-20s out of college, with no direction, no idea what they want to do with their life, and feel completely unaccomplished compared to their peers?

1,Are you seriously trying to quit your job during a global pandemic and impending recession? o_O,1250,g4d70n,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g4d70n/are_you_seriously_trying_to_quit_your_job_during/,188,"This will probably be downvoted to hell. That’s okay. 

But really, there has been an uptick in people posting about quitting their jobs. This isn’t to berate you. If you aren’t happy, you really should find a way to leave. Your mental health and professional fulfilment is much MUCH more important in the long run. 

HOWEVER, if you know that you don’t have a fat kitty saved up or a wealthy family to fall back on- please don’t make the jump just yet! The same goes for those in jobs with an easier ‘replacement index’ or ‘entry bar’ (cringe). Don’t do it!

Think long and hard. Where I am, the depression from the lockdown retrenchments alone has led to a rise in suicides. Quitting your job and then finding yourself in the cold may put you in a worse off position.

This is sounding harsh but it is coming from a good place. Things are going to work out. We just don’t know when. In the meantime, hang in there. Take this global lockdown time to plan your exit meticulously, save up and start skilling up for the jump. 

Good luck!",1587351475.0,2020-04-19 22:57:55
2,"Anyone else graduated, got in a 'career' and realise there was more to life than work?",1147,gh3k6s,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gh3k6s/anyone_else_graduated_got_in_a_career_and_realise/,233,"It's probably the number 1 thing driving me into depression. I can't come to terms with the fact that as I'm coming to 30, never have I felt more certain that the idea of a 'career' or working for the rest of my life in some repetitive job just to support my housing, family and retirement, is just NO life.

I'm not sure if it's bad experiences, or not knowing what exactly it is I want to do. Heck, I'm being paid 55k, but have already decided I will resign before the end of the year, leave London, and move back to my hometown (where opportunities are limited). This is simply because, after several years of slaving it out in an office, I so desperately miss feeling PURPOSE in life. Whether that's living under mum's roof and feeling the love of living with my family, being at University, and being surrounded by some of the best friends and richest experiences, being young and adventurous, traveling. Living life. 

Ever since I graduated and got into the 'workforce', aka, sitting at my corporate desk all day every day, life has been a misery. Eeach and every day typically morphs into the same scenario, wake up early, feel tired, commute, spend x hours under intense stress, commute home, change, cook, wash dishes, maybe go gym, bed, repeat. Then the weekend. Even weekends are duller than they used to be because people are so busy or spend time with their other halves or whatever else.

I came to realise through a lot of self-reflection during lockdown, that it's not the job, or the industry (I changed industry to mix it up and try something new). I realised that selling all of my time just to receive a paycheck, is nonsense. To the point where I'd rather resign and be unemployed whilst preparing for long-term travelling. It's strange because I want someone to tell me I'm barking mad, to leave a nice paid 55k job in the city for what I want - but you can't help what you feel. I'd imagine it's like a gay person and bottling up their feelings and then eventually coming out. For me, the truest thing I feel in my heart is that I just don't want to work 9-5 for the rest of my life, full stop. I want more out of life than living for the weekend, than defining my life and value by my 'work'. I can't derive value from anything else because I spend 80% of my waking time at work/commuting. No job has ever brought me any sense of purpose in life. It just draws me down further, gradually.

I just think it's an incredble shame, that we spend our lives in the pursuit of careers, selling our health, our time, our relationships and everything else just to put money in the bank and jump on the old societal bandwagon of buying a house and settling down. I thought after going into uni and then into the exciting world of financial services, that I had life set. But suddenly, I could not want it less. Even the idea of spending 30 years paying off a mortgage disinterests me. I find it a grim and miserable idea. What's wrong with me? But scarily, there's no viable alternative. It seems though a lot of people around my age who think similarly travel, so that's what I'm considering also.

Any others feel the same way?",1589153554.0,2020-05-10 19:32:34

5,Does anyone else get anxiety when looking at LinkedIn?,998,jei9il,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jei9il/does_anyone_else_get_anxiety_when_looking_at/,164,"I frequently go on LinkedIn to check for new job postings in order to propel my potential career change.

6,"I hate office culture, I hate my job, am burnt out and my mental health is suffering. After COVID dies down, I just want to work on building a life where I'll be happy. How can I make a realistic plan?",935,gyyc4j,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gyyc4j/i_hate_office_culture_i_hate_my_job_am_burnt_out/,136,"Firstly, I'll just preface this post by saying that I KNOW I'm lucky to have kept my job during COVID. I'm aware that many people have lost their jobs because of the pandemic and been forced into difficult situations (and my heart goes out to them). However, I hope it can be taken into account that many of us are struggling in many different ways right now.

Without getting into too much detail, I've been extremely unhappy with my job for some time now and was planning on leaving until COVID happened. I'm a copywriter at a marketing company. I honestly hate sales and marketing writing. I also now feel stuck and like I can't plan a proper exit strategy. I'm currently experiencing total employee burnout and my performance is really starting to slip. I haven't slept at all in the past night and this happens regularly. I'm also not eating properly and am just dealing with anxiety, depression and fatigue. I can hardly think or focus on anything.

However, my general feelings about this really aren't a result of what's happened with COVID. I've honestly been feeling this way for quite a long time now. My company's current work from home setup has not improved any of this, but even pre-COVID my company was very poorly managed, with a lot of inexperienced people running the show and an extreme lack of organization. There's a lot of trite, stupid stuff the company forces everyone to do to try to ""make sure we work as a team"". There are constant, excessive amounts of hour-long, sometimes two hour-long meetings (with an increased frequency during our current WFH setup), where nobody contributes anything valuable to a conversation and where I get the sense that they're only arranged so that managers feel relevant. There's a whooole lot of office politics and people getting their own way by kissing up to the right people. It's all so repulsive, fake and so many of these processes just take away from my productivity.

As someone who is by nature quite introverted and who greatly dislikes having to navigate through annoying people problems, constantly having to tread around the politics, put on a face and play a game every week has become so mentally draining. And that's not even on top of all the work I have. It's a regular occurrence that I work MANY extra hours on top of my regular ones, all of which I'm not paid for. Before we started WFH, I'd regularly stay at the office until 8, sometimes 9pm trying to get work done. Now, I just keep working and don't turn my computer off until late hours in the day.

I've had several people tell me I should find a better job and that my current company isn't run well, but I honestly fear that every office job is like this. That every office job will involve having to say things that you wouldn't normally say to people for 8 hours a day, having to participate in pretentious, vapid and unproductive meetings for the sake of making the more ego-driven staff feel important, having to listen to coworkers talk more about other people than the work itself, being constantly distracted, having to tread on eggshells, etc. I know many have probably said something of the like before me, but it just seems like there should be so much more to life than this. I see other people at my company who seem so excited about the culture, who seem so personable and like they fit into it so well, and I can't help but wonder... is it just me who sees through all of this, or are they just better actors than I am?

I'm a writer and an artist and as much as I am preparing to hear answers such as ""this is life"", ""most people have to deal with this to get by financially"" and ""you won't make any money and will struggle taking an alternative route"", I really can't fathom the idea of spending another 10 years of my life dealing with office culture and putting my time and energy into a climate I despise so much. I really want to value myself, my talents and my life more than this. I really don't want to live anymore if this is all there is to life.

Does anyone have a story they can share about how they transitioned out of this lifestyle and took on a job that allowed them more time to work on their creative pursuits? Such as working at a coffee shop, restaurant or something where you can clock in/clock out a little more easily? I know taking a pay cut is inevitable, but I want to explore the possibility of actually living a lifestyle that will make me happier. Feedback is welcome, and I apologize if this is lengthy and if any of this doesn't sound realistic.",1591647832.0,2020-06-08 16:23:52
7,Why do people brag about being overworked and neglecting their health for their job?,935,ke8d2y,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ke8d2y/why_do_people_brag_about_being_overworked_and/,187,"You guys know those people that thinks its a competition to see who struggles the hardest and looks down on those who doesn't struggle as much as they do or had to back in day?

Why do you people say this shit like that's something to the proud of? Putting your health on hold to make $8 an hour isn't some noble duty.

You will unironically hear people brag about how they worked so many hours that they haven't seen their 7 year old son in a month.

I’m about to have a bachelors degree in sociology. I love sociology but I don’t know if I’m passionate about it. I just assumed I’d go to grad school eventually and my life would be sorted, maybe I’d be a lawyer, maybe I’d be a professor, in reality I probably won’t even be a high-school teacher at the very least. I started thinking maybe I’ll use my degree to go to teachers  college but I don’t even think I’d get accepted into that. I basically wasted my time in university, I didn’t do any fascinating internships or have any research opportunities. I got average grades and didn’t bond with my professors and don’t have any connections. The most interesting thing I’ve done is be apart of a couple clubs and working as a supervised access worker this summer. Forget begging for grad school references last minute, I don’t even think I deserve them. I still think I tried really hard to be involved in clubs and keep my grades up, amongst being low income and dealing with a mental health disorder. But now I literally don’t know what to do with my life. The only thing I’ve ever been passionate about is helping other people and sadly that’s not a job. My parents expect me to do something amazing with my life, being the first person from our family to enter university but now it feels like I’m going to end up working at McDonald’s or going to community college after already having a bachelors degree, just so I can have a decent job. Not to mention I’m now $30,000 in dept, and that’s on the high-school education system convincing me that getting an arts degree in something I’m slightly interested in at an elitist institution would answer all my questions but all it did was give me a unjustified superiority complex, dept and bad mental health.

In America, and possible other countries that use American English, the word is spelled 'License'; in Canada and the UK, it is not. 

On my resume I have a section near the end that lists a few licences and certifications I have. The interview was for a very large engineering company that gave me the interview after a recommendation I received, so I assume they only glanced at the resume before giving me a call.

The interview itself was supposed to be an hour, but it only lasted around 45 minutes. I was being interviewed by a man, Joe, and a woman, Jane. Near the beginning of the interview Joe points something out on my resume to Jane and smirks, I knew the area of my resume he was looking at and assumed it was to do with a cert I have that doesn't formally expire so the formatting is weird.

The interview went really well, but it all fell apart at the end when we were wrapping up, Joe said ""just one last question, how do you not proofread a resume?"". He followed it up with a comment about how it otherwise looked great and I obviously put time into it, but this typo was jarring. I asked what typo and he just pointed at 'Licence'; my reaction was shock and a stunned silence before I said ""that's how you spell that"". Which he didn't like. He chuckled at my comment and sounded really annoyed when he just spat out that no, it wasn't. I didn't know what to say so I doubled down and he got very annoyed / angry and became pretty condescending.

I launch new products, i do trainings, I do follow ups etc but all-in-all I do jack shit. This constant 8-years lucky strike made out of me an extremely lazy and procrastinating dude. I don't want to do any additional certificate because hwat's the point? I don't want to switch companies because I'm afraid in my next job I'll need to work 40 hours.

Seriously am I alone? Any help? I know I should enjoy it but I'm scared I have a big meat clever over my head that will drop one day.

They let go almost half the company around May and since then I’ve had to pick up the slack in different, unrelated departments and this has caused me to either drop the ball on new projects (that are totally unrelated to my day to day tasks) or have things slip through the cracks in my normal responsibilities. For example, I just realized that 2 weeks ago I forgot to confirm the information on something with an external contact and now it’s possible we’ll have to pay to correct the mistake that I should’ve have double checked on!

What can I do?,475,k7ead9,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/k7ead9/dropped_out_of_medical_school_with_230k_in_debt/,204,"I'm fucked. I have been going through a family situation since 2016. My dad has abandoned my mom to me, and I was supposed to be her meal ticket.

Currently I have $134k in student debt, my mom's $93k mortgage, and my credit card debt is going to be up $3k within 6 months.

I only have a bachelor's in Biology from a fine, okayish state university. I went directly into medical school afterwards.

While she can pay off my debt with the assets she gained from the divorce, I refuse to touch it as that is her retirement and she has nothing else to lean on. As an immigrant, her English skills aren't good enough and she does have an outdated nursing certificate and experience as a daycare assistant. She recently worked as a nanny, which she cannot continue to do because she has osteoarthritis and slipped discs affecting her ability to lift heavy things. She was recently laid off but makes ends meet as an occasional babysitter.

The options I'm looking at:

1. **Grad school / other medical avenues:** I'm not sure I can afford more grad school just to make an extra $10k/year
2. **Temp agencies:** I seem to only qualify for jobs mostly retail / production / covid testing. I need something more stable and long-term.
3. **Teaching:** Getting a master's in teaching, then seeking loan forgiveness by working in a poor school. I have experience in this, having worked as a tutor / test prep instructor, but it's never something I'm interested in as a career. Given the salary, I don't know if I can stick in there without the passion.
4. **Joining the military:** This is completely against everything that I stand for, there's a reason why I didn't apply for the HPSP in med school. I have similar reservations about this as I said earlier in #3.
5. **Fleeing the country and TEFL:** Also not a long-term, viable solution for savings and retirement.
6. **Marrying a rich woman:** I'm 5'5'' and have psychosexual issues due to a dysfunctional family. Also, I'm ugly.

I'm seriously considering using the rest of my savings $40K to pay off the mortgage, leave a holographic will naming her the executor and beneficiary, and then killing myself in a location where my dad who disowned me can find my corpse.

I have a part-time job on the side that doesn't make much or has any benefits. Is it worth leaving this job for the sake of my mental health and stick out working part-time until something better arrives? 

I've been working for an organization for the past year under an extremely toxic boss. At first, I accepted her micromanaging because I was working in a field that I had no experience in and wanted to make sure that I was doing my job correctly. After a few months at the organization, I was asked to take on additional responsibilities because a co-worker left and that only exacerbated my working relationship with my boss. She constantly lied to me saying that the other manager I was assisting thought I was doing a horrible job and didn't understand why I was doing what I was doing. She demeaned my work performance (whilst managing two brand new roles), telling me I was unqualified to do even the basic functions of my job. I try to work as independently as possible, but because of her micromanagement style, she doesn't hesitate to complain to directors that she constantly has to manage my work. I've tried going back to the directors about this, and they are unwilling to hear my side of things. 

But as a result of the constant undermining, I've started to notice a decline in my performance. I'm constantly on-edge with everything I do and say. Not only does she negatively critique my work and performance, but she also doesn't hesitate to criticize the way I write my emails to vendors and other associates too. It's gotten to the point where I'm petrified responding back to any email I receive. Currently, I'm going to a therapist to help me cope with her behavior and started taking anti-anxiety medication.

I spoke with the person that had the position before me and they ended up leaving the role after five months due to the stress and anxiety our boss caused. 

I've worked in other high-pressure roles in the past but nothing compares to working with her. 

Luckily, I'm in a good position financially if I need to quit. I also have a part-time job that I've had for 15 years that's not a part of my career path, but can offer a temporary income (albeit not much).

Right now, my company is obviously working at home because of COVID. When I found out that we'd be working from home for an extended period of time, I was honestly really happy. As someone whose job requires a lot of focus and solitude, I really thrive when I'm just by myself and can zone in on my work without distractions. However, management keeps speaking to our company like they are worried about us all being shut-in and not being in the office. We're now forced to have some meetings every day (over Zoom), that we otherwise have once or twice a week in the office (for a couple of them, it's starting to seem like people don't know what to talk about). In addition to this, management keeps planning all of these ""social"" activities over Zoom that they aren't making voluntary.

I'm the only person who has my role at my company and we've taken a hard hit because of COVID. As such, I've actually had a huge increase in my workload since this has happened, which I've tried desperately to stay on top of. I won't lie - this situation has caused me to feel extremely burnt out and stressed as I'm trying my best to cope with everything. I feel like my main duty is to do my job and stay on top of it, and having to keep breaking my focus is making this so much tougher. I just want to be at home and focus on my work so I can get through this, and all of this forced social crap is infuriating.

I don't want to say something that will get me into any trouble, but I also don't understand why they are ""forcing"" these activities and not sort of advertising them for people to do if they wish/if they have spare time.

Weekends were definitely spent studying and catching up on work. Schoolwork was a 24/7 kind of thing, and it was certainly exacerbated by my school’s quarter system. I probably put in at minimum 2X more work than what I’m doing now in my corporate job. 

Now contrast this to worklife now, and it’s fairly light in comparison.  There’s usually a cutoff time for work, meaning I can just shut off after like 6pmish. I don’t work weekends and the pay is alright. Some days I only have to put in around 4 hours of “real work” in the office. My job is not repetitive either. I work in software product management, not like data entry, accounting, or something like that. 

And yet, I’m feeling much more depressed and drained mentally for some reason. I’ve never had this feeling in my life before, and I’m actually not sure why because objectively speaking, the “work” is less than what I did in college. 

Basically, it feels like a dementor is sucking out all my energy and mood every day. When I get home I have to take a nap and my mind just shuts off.  At first, it wasn’t too bad, but then this never ending cycle started accumulating.  The days started to blend, then the weeks, now I feel like I’m counting in months. I don’t even get excited on holidays anymore because it’s a reminder of how little control over my time I have. 

I’m wondering if this is just a personal problem or there’s something I’m not catching. 

Why is it that I’m able to float around some corporate job and do 50% less work than what I did as student, get paid for it, and still feel like shit?

Is it part of the process of life? Is it the constant routine? The work actual job or company itself? Maybe because there is no more autonomy? Or perhaps my memory is selectively choosing to remember only the positive aspects of college? Or maybe I’m just mentally weak?

During the presentation I kept on getting interrupted - as I only had 15 mins of their time, i felt frustrated and might have unconsciously been thinking negatively so i accidentally added an ""f"" word in one of my example scenarios while I was explaining. I have since apologised especially when one of the PO brought it up during one of our lunch gatherings - I understood that its unprofessional.

It had been months since the incident happened but the same PO who was in the meeting is still acting very passive aggressive towards me. For example, today she attempted to embarrass me in front of everyone during our remote meetings by asking if I'm working inside a toilet.. after that, we had a group picture on ZOOM and someone decided to use Donald Trump as their profile picture, since I was the one who took a screenshot of the group picture she accused me of adding in Donald Trump after sharing it to the group.. and she broadcasted it to everyone in our group chat.

To my defence, I am not the only one who curses in the meetings but it seems that she's just targeting me, what should I do? and please don't lecture me how wrong it was to curse, I've beaten myself too much about it already.  


EDIT: Hi guys, I was not expecting the pouring of support from everyone. I thought that I'll get the opposite response that's why I was defensive in the last paragraph.

Tried to learn coding during the lockdown, but it just doesn't sit in my head. I've tried so many times so hard, but I don't seem to be able to grasp it. 

I tried venturing into creative fields which involve some of my interests. For example tried writing articles for a football website and even though one got featured. I struggle to keep coming up with them. Most of the things I cover are what others already do, there's no USP to my stuff. 
Got a part time unpaid internship as a food blogger too, and again, same struggle. I'm just not creative enough. I try so hard for so long, but can't come up with anything interesting or unique. 
I feel I'm not creative enough for the non-technical jobs, but not analytical enough for the technical jobs. I try to work hard to change it, but it doesn't come off no matter what.

I'm so scared that I'm going to be unemployed, because I have no skills. My resume is all over the place and I have direction whatsoever. I feel like I've wasted my university life too.

You know, cause they represent a company and want to present a positive image.

I had an HR person email me one line: When can you come in for an interview?

That was it. It was unusual, but I thought maybe a bad day or multitasking. Trying to give the benefit of the doubt.  I then read the company reviews on Indeed. Now, I know that is not the end all be all for a company, but I wanted to get a sense. Managers left reviews that were days apart about how great it is to work there. Employee reviews were sporadic and only one star reviews.  

I acutally found the job on a local free site - something similar to Craig's List. 

During my interview, I was pretty convinced the manager didn't even read my resume. He kept asking about my experience with X and did I know about this professional organization - uh yeah, if you saw my resume you would know I'm a member, earned an industry certificate and am currently studying for another one, in addition to over 10 years of work experience.

When I asked about investing in employee growth, the manager said they only provide this one course and if I wanted to do anything else I could do so on my free time.  What about professional conferences? Nope, we don't do that.

When the hiring manager asked for my salary requirements, I provided a very reasonable salary for a small company while factoring in my (not bragging, really) years of experience. About 20 minutes after my interview, I recieved an email from HR saying the company starts at $15 an hour. I mean, maybe mention that up front and not waste time. 

So, snarky and unfriendly HR, possible lack of money (despite being told they're growing) to advertise for positions, managers that don't read resumes, poor pay, very bad Indeed reviews. I definitely dodged a bullet. 

Sweet onion chutney, I've been doing this job searching bs for the last year and it's getting quite tiresome.

So please help me out. 

I babysit for this family. They have a 3 year old who I love to death. I've known the mom ever since I was little because my parents are friends with hers. The mom is 23 now. She WAS a single parent when she first needed me to babysit back in September. And now she is married. They are both cops that work in the jails. 

When she first needed me she was a single mom and I told her to pay me as much as she could and she told me she could only do $25 a day (she only needs me Saturday and sunday). So I was okay with it because that's all she could afford. I originally would start at 12:45 PM and go till 9:30 -10 pm and then she started to need me earlier. From 12:45, 12:30, 12:00, 11:30 am, 11am, and sometimes to 10am.

She ended up getting more serious with her boyfriend and he moved in so I ended up getting off around 7 PM. Now they're married so they have two incomes coming in. Their schedules got changed so now they both work from 5:30 am to 2pm, so they need me to come over at 4:45am till 3 PM. 

I did the math for how much im getting paid by the hour and it's around $2.72. I live with my boyfriend now, and with the whole coronavirus this is my only source of income since the other family I baby sat for doesn't need me any more.  I'm not sure if I should tell her I need to be getting paid more and I'm not sure how to tell her especially because when I needed to be paid in advance she did that for me and gave me $150. I ended up almost working all the days off for it, but she recently just told me that she decided to forget about it and started paying me again, so now I'd feel bad If I told her I need to be paid more

Some of us were part of a major company initiative, and there is a strong since of camaraderie amongst those who were part of it and are still with the company.

*You can imagine their surprise when I put in my two-week notice a few days ago.*

Despite the good vibes mentioned earlier, I had not received a raise or promotion since I started. I met with my boss and supervisor several times, and was told the earliest they could promote me or give me a raise was in 6-7 months from now. I recently took an interview with another company, and offered the promotion and raise I was looking for. I accepted it because it's what's best for my career.

Since my boss and my direct supervisor were both out of the office on the day I received the offer and my start date with the new company is soon, I e-mailed them a professional note announcing my resignation effective in two weeks and thanking them for their support during my time with them. My coworkers' reaction upon finding out from my boss and supervisor have been all over the map.

My supervisor, who I shared a good relationship with, didn't talk to me for three days. When he finally met with me behind closed doors, he berated me for leaving - though also asked if there is any counteroffer the company could make after saying I 'burned a bridge' with him, which was sort of a weird 180. A couple of other coworkers who are part of the ""camaraderie"" still haven't spoken to me. My boss, though he understands my decision, was not shy about mentioning the staffing woes the department is now in (we were understaffed even before I put in notice). On the contrary, one superior  who I thought would be indifferent has become my biggest supporter, wishing me the best and saying the company played itself by not promoting me when they should have.

I remember somehow got all B in my O levels but did TERRIBLE in A level.

I am an introvert due to the reason i used to be mocked down, i even remember being humiliated because i was a very short for a guy (that's not an understatement) 156 cm to be precise so i avoided people as much i could and even teachers. At the time back in highschool and even in university i never knew why i sucked at studying and would always procastinate.

When i got into university, i tried to change a little and join a student association. It was going well till i kept fucking up by failling over and over as i lost touch with people due to being in different years and often due to us having different schedule

Got kicked out as i failed 3 times the same year and had to wait one more (it's normally 2 years one year is gone) and it was a depressing year for me and i often lacked motivation to do anything. Needless to say my parents weren't very happy and never believed me whenn i tried to tell them i was depressed and honestly they are very negative. Saw a psychiatrist and found out i have ADHD and i am on therapy for that.( According to her might be the main reason i flunked everything : doing much better now thanks to therapy and medications)

Did first year in med school, then the two next year in law school

I decided to work this year to save as much as money as i can and move out and maybe hoping to start university again next year and having a fresh start.And maybe redo the CESS exams(Similar to A levels exams in Belgium) I am honestly scared considering i fuck up really bad last time and not only that my whole life, i couldnt even keep a simple relation with someone. Is it to old ? I mean being 26 next year and being surrounded by people much younger than i am feels like a remainder that i fucked up really bad. Even for this i don't know if i really do it all over again : last time it didn't turn to be a great experience. And even thought to go into STEM

Why pass CESS again ( it's basically the equivalent of A level) ? My A LEVELS wasnt so great so i will pass it to have good results and trying apply to EPFL (they ask 80%)

I am posting this as i really want to know what people think as i have no one to turn to",1597551921.0,2020-08-16 00:25:21

How do I bridge this knowledge gap? Literally the only thing I can do is write. Right now, my plan is to work as a writer or communications officer in related agencies, then later pursue a master’s degree once I have enough work experience. Is this the right approach?

Has anyone been in a similar situation? Especially someone who also switched from the arts to the sciences? How did you do it? How difficult was it to transition to a completely different field?

Work in sales and  have done for just shy of a year, before that I was in a financial  brokerage for a year, and an investment bank for a year. Graduated in Business Management in the UK, on a 4 year with a placement.

The  thing is and this has been the case for all my life and probably is for  many - there's just not something I am so passionate about that I want  to invest all my time specialising in. I left finance because I actually  hated the environment, the people. It was so toxic at one point I  resigned from my brokerage and luckily landed a job in tech sales. It's  now been just shy of a year and there's always so much pressure with  targets and aside from COVID for one moment, your job is under threat  after a period of time if you don't keep up with the numbers.

As  I approach 30, I have come to realise that life ISN'T worth this kind  of stress. And yet I'm earning £50k GBP which is in terms of averages,  pretty decent going for a 29 year old. But it's somehow not important to  me. If anything, it's easy to compare to some of my younger friends who  are in banking and earn even more than that and will continue to earn  more and more. I find myself looking up and thinking I should be doing  better, rather than looking down at say retail workers who earn 20k for  example. Heck, I'm talking to a Brazilian lady on a dating app who is 35  and works in a retail store as well as a restaurant receptionist - I  suddenly look much better than her. It's easy to forget.

But  I think I would be happier if you told me that I found my  girlfriend/wife to be, and was earning 20k, rather than earning say 50k  as I am and being single. There's just nothing that makes me think life  is worth repeating day in day out just to pay a mortgage, retire, and  then die. It just feels so unimportant. I guess I was never lucky enough  to discover my 'passion' from a young age and implement it into my  work. I'm into football but don't want any job around that other than be  a professional football player, which I am not.

I  recently started to look into coding and weigh up whether this would be  worth my time. It's actually interesting, but reading between the lines  it seems that it's going to be very challenging finding work in this  area without a degree, notto mention take years to learn enough to be  job ready.

I just feel kind of  lost and always have done with 'work'. Like there's never been an  underlying purpose/motivation behind it. Anyone else having career blues  around a similar age?",1585538377.0,2020-03-29 23:19:37

About the role:
- I got a job as a technical manager in a fitout contracting business. It is my first role as a full time manager. I was excited for the challenge.
- The company is unstructured, and is ongoing budget cuts due to being over taken by new management. Budget cuts are coming in the form of understaffing projects, 6 day weeks, no OT and overloading current employees with tasks and projects.
- Projects are unstructured, and employees seem burnt out. 

About my experience as a manager so far:
- I discovered that I am a poor communicator. I dont clearly relay my message to colleagues or managers. I don't clearly or coherently convey issues or risks.
- Management are easily being manipulative due to my lack of experience. They gave me more than I can handle,  and downplayed the risk and overload of work.
- I am prone to panicking and rushing to meet deadlines. I feel like I am failing because I succumb to pressure and overblown deadlines.
- Poorly timing the escalation of issues or queries.
- Lots of resistance from team members as they feel I am either too nice or too aggressive and totally not organized or structured.

I’m currently an IT analyst in a trainee program for graduates that the company offers, and I’m getting paid nearly minimum wage. I am the lowest paid among the entire IT devision, and I’ve been doing the workload of more senior positions. Often times, I’ve worked overtime, and I don’t even get paid overtime. 

Many people have told me that the entertainment industry often exploits their workers and underpays them, and this is true.

My job is extremely political, and has given me intense anxiety since I started working. I’ve been promised a promotion 3 times this year, and all 3 times, the promotion has been pushed back. My trainee program ends in December, and I was promised (yet again) that I would receive my promotion then. 

Many people in my division have been laid off from the company during these past couple of months, and work has been really slow lately (probably to reduce cost), but I realize that they might be keeping me around because I am the cheapest to keep.  

I haven’t asked for a pay raise because I feel like it might be insensitive during this time. 

The program ends in December, and I’ve recently started taking an online bootcamp to try to improve my skills and hopefully get a new job asap. Because of this, my work hours have been flexible to accommodate my bootcamp hours.

Anyway, I have calculated unemployment, and learned that it actually pays more than what I make now. 

I’m actually scared that I will get offered a promotion after this program ends in December, and at this point I’d rather get laid off. The company culture is extremely toxic to my mental health, but I won’t be able to get unemployment if I quit. 

Is it bad that I want to quit? How should I go about this?

What are some good ideas to consider moving forward?",332,fuwy9w,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fuwy9w/ive_been_unhappy_with_my_job_for_a_while_and_was/,41,"I’m sure I’m one of MANY people posting about this same problem, so I’ll first just apologize about this in advance. I’ll also preface this post by saying that I know I’m fortunate to not be out of work right now.

I’ve been pretty unhappy with my job for some time now, and right around this time was when I was planning to look for another one (ironically, I had gone on a trip before COVID-19 broke out and my plan was to do this after I got back home). In summary, here are the reasons why:

* Long hours, understaffing and me agreeing to way too much in the past year has led to me wearing far too many hats. I’m burnt out, never able to complete everything each week and management is aware, but doesn’t seem to do anything about it.
* My role has changed from one where I was supposed to be a creative contributor to my company to one where I just manage and oversee logistics all day. It wasn’t what I signed up to do and I don’t even get to do any of the responsibilities I was originally given when I started (which was work I actually enjoyed, is in line with my skill set and that was valuable for both the company and my resume). Duties that were once mine are now just outsourced by third parties and managed by me. It's definitely not the same thing as what I joined to do, at all.
* Management knows I want to go back to my original duties and have repeatedly told me they will do this for me and reevaluate processes, only to then keep roping me into the very duties (mentioned above) that keep me from doing just that and doing absolutely nothing they promise.
* Management is young, inexperienced and not good at fixing problems when they’re brought to attention. This results in me and other colleagues getting the brunt of other people’s problems.
* According to market trends (at least before COVID), I was being underpaid and overworked for this role. I’m not sure if this still stands now.

Overall, I’ve been unhappy for quite some time now and I don’t feel like this job is at all aligned with my career goals at all. I’ve managed to keep my job and work from home during the pandemic, which makes me feel like an even bigger POS for complaining. But with that being said, I can tell that taking our company online is already starting to worsen the lack of organization and alignment. On top of stress over what’s happening in the world right now, I know my mental health is not in great shape dealing with this role. Even prior to this, I was dealing with working late hours, extreme burnout and lack of sleep. I still want to make the best of my life and my career during this time and I know I’m not doing it here.

With all this being said, I am perfectly happy with working from home (I'm a bit of an introvert and actually fare really well with it) and the type of work I do is very easy to do remotely. Is it worth the risk to still look for something else right now or am I making a bad move? I’d love to know if anyone else has greater insight on the remote market right now or what that’s looking like. It's been over a year since I've looked for a job and I've never looked for a wholly remote opportunity before.",1586047825.0,2020-04-04 20:50:25
128,"As a classical musician in New York City, I was living my dream - then COVID hit and I lost all my work indefinitely. All concerts cancelled up to Summer 2021, at least. Should I change careers?",326,i02msc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/i02msc/as_a_classical_musician_in_new_york_city_i_was/,86,"Hi everyone, I've never used Reddit before but I am really in need of some advice. Please forgive me if this post is a bit long, but I would greatly appreciate any and all input.

I am a classical musician, a field which is extremely insular and not very well understood by those outside of it. Basically I started playing an instrument when I was a very young child. After realizing it was what I love more than anything else, I decided to pursue it professionally - this meant practicing hours upon hours every day, traveling to auditions (and getting rejected constantly), shelling out a LOT of money for instruments, lessons, etc. Basically this becomes your life. I got a Bachelor's degree from Juilliard, and during that time I was freelancing throughout New York. I was slowly building a solid reputation. I also began taking professional orchestra auditions, which are notoriously soul-crushing and competitive (flying at your own cost around the country to audition for jobs that can pay up to 6 figures), and I actually ended up getting runner-up for a couple of those auditions, which is almost universally considered a sign that it's ""just a matter of time"". I had played sub weeks with big orchestras, and made thousands of $. My resume was in a very good place. My parents were still paying my rent, but overall I felt my career was making progress. I was gigging, teaching, auditioning, and loving my work so much. I was in my first year of a Master's degree at Juilliard when COVID hit. I lost all of my work, all auditions were cancelled, and almost every orchestra - big or small - in the US cancelled their entire 2020-2021 seasons. There is no real ETA on when concerts might resume. I searched desperately for a day job so I could afford my New York apartment. I landed a job at a local bike shop, where they insulted and berated me daily so I had to leave it. I couldn't land any day job after that (NYC unemployment is currently 20%), so I had no choice but to swallow my pride and leave New York City.

I moved with my girlfriend of 5 years into her grandparents' basement. This is, at least as of the time of writing, my rock bottom. I am still just barely practicing my music, maybe an hour a day at best, and every day it becomes just a little bit harder. Every time I pick up my instrument, I just think about how fucked I am, how I will never make money doing this. How long I will be living in basements. We have no car here and it is extremely suburban so all we do is sit in the basement and occasionally go for walks. That is literally it. Every day feels the same and I have lost track of time. 

Kevin O'Leary said ""money is freedom"" and I couldn't agree more. Every day I lie around in the basement I feel my soul, my essence and everything I am motivated to do, slowly withering away. I have suicidal thoughts for this first time in a VERY long time. For the first time in my life, I am starting to wonder if going into music was a mistake. Even with my ""success"", I am starting to wonder if this is worth living like a dog in a basement. I am more desperate than ever to start making money and get my own apartment again.

Should I put music aside and try to change careers? And if so, how could I even go about doing that right now? So many of my skills as a musician are transferable to other sectors - my work as a teacher, my experience with music history and theory, curating concerts, etc...

I just need to make some money. If I stay in this situation much longer I have no idea how low I will sink.

However, everyday a male 30 yr old M coworker Skype messages and calls me multiple times even on the weekend to “train me” whenever my boss told me specifically to never work weekends.  This male coworker is aware of my perfect exam score because it was sent in an email by my boss.

My boss told me on numerous occasions I can only work a certain amount of hours for sales in this company and HR will give me a warning if I’m over the allotted hours. I’m only allowed to work 40 hours per week just for reference. 

I told this coworker that I really appreciate him reaching out to help but I’ve already went through training and can’t work over the weekends or even sign into my laptop to navigate the CRM we would need.

Since then he still insists I call him over the weekend now on my cellphone and not work phone for him to “go over work info.”

Also, this guy continuously sends memes in our team group chat on Skype that my boss is apart of and no one ever replies to his memes since they’re usually politically motivated and just not work appropriate in general.

145,Retail is crushing my soul. I got in trouble today for coming in on time. How do I find happiness before I just give up on everything?,313,i6uqbc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/i6uqbc/retail_is_crushing_my_soul_i_got_in_trouble_today/,77,"Yes, seriously. I showed up when I was scheduled and apparently they had f-ed up the schedule and I was supposed to start an hour later. I showed them the online copy where it said I showed up on time and then got a huge talking to and was told I ""should have known better.""

But down to the nitty gritty... I've been in retail for 16 years total. I've been at my current job for 5.5 years. Started part-time and fought my way up to full-time after 3 years. Believe me it was a fight, but I make a decent wage now and have benefits. It's the only thing keeping me there.

Not trying to toot my own horn but I do way more than I should have to. The other cashiers do nothing - and that's okay because I have to keep busy. I can't stand around. I am always tidying so the front end is presentable and in addition I'm in charge of: merchandising and stocking the front end, tagging, ordering and stocking the drink cooler, changing the road sign weekly and keeping track of supplies. If they ask me to work on the floor, I do. I'm happy to do anything. They are also switching me to the new customer service desk full-time - while I still keep the same tasks at cash. Essentially doubling the load. The others won't step up - I know because I went on vacation in July for 2 weeks and when I came back the front end was destroyed. It took me a week to fix it and guess who got in shit? Me.

Want another one? I hurt my back outside of work and the next day asked if I could take it easy a little (no running around, heavy lifting). The manager responded by wheeling up a pallet jack full of drinks to fill the cooler with.

I'm just so fucking tiredddd of being the punching bag. I hate my life right now. I could go back to school but I get terrible social anxiety (customer service persona ftw). I just honestly want to work with animals. They're the only thing that makes me happy. Groomer, daycare worker, shelter worker, I don't honestly care. I just can't take these people anymore :(

&#x200B;

I work in the hospital lab in a very specialized position. Specialized to a point there are only 1500 of us in the country roughly. One of the bigger cons of this is I can't just go work somewhere else. If I had a family that lived here and something happened or I quit, I can't go to the town over or down the road, I would have to move hours away for another job. I feel like I am forever at the mercy of my employer.

&#x200B;

I got into 4 different masters programs when I finished college. I did so many different jobs, trying to find the one that felt right. My mom has always been money minded, so when I got into my graduate program with the expectation of making 75k+ a year, she was thrilled and pushed me to do it. I was excited, and this program had a higher salary and a higher liklihood of employment (though limited, they don't tell you that part). I started med school not fully knowing what it was, but got through everything just fine with great grades. During rotation year I remember thinking ""Is this what I want to do for the next 30 years of my life?""

&#x200B;

I started working at my current job a year ago. Two months in, I was already uncomfortable. The healthcare field is viscious, and our leaders in my group are as well. Since I've started I have seen the revoling door of employment, and have seen 8 people come and go since my first day, only 8 months ago. When I started, I was making 75k, and as a new graduate with more loans than that number I was happy. But as time went on, I became a wreck. My ex left me for a week because I would just come home and cry. I was miserable. I've applied to other places, but it's so specialized and so few positions anywhere even remotely close that I am SOL most of the time. I wondered why the people I worked under during rotations seemed so burnt out and miserable, saying the spark will go away fast, and now I know. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Recently it's gotten worse. Everybody's pay got cut at least 20-25%. My hours got increased, and I'm doing 55 hours a week now. I am constantly walking on eggshells waiting to get in trouble for sneezing when I should have coughed, knowing if even a whiff of something not perfect gets out that I will be absolutely fired. 

&#x200B;

Besides the employer issues, this job may physically be killing me. I'm pretty certain I will have a stroke by 40 with all this stress. Once I'm off work, I can't relax. On top of that, my back is constantly hurting, and that's just how it is and nothing can fix or prevent that. This job is also just relatively dangerous, and I've already gotten pneumonia and TB from patients before. 

&#x200B;

My passion is dead. It was short lived, it existed momentarily, but it's dead.

&#x200B;

I told my mom months ago I wasn't a fan, she told me it's just a phase. I told her in winter, again, suck it up you don't mean it. Now that the world is falling apart and the hospital is running itself and employers into the ground, I told her again that I'm not in love with this job. It makes good money, but I'm not happy. I can't have a family or relationship and feel happy knowing 1/3 of my day is spent in nonstop worry and anxiety. I told her I want to look elsewhere for other jobs, and she said I am being dramatic and need to stop, they put themselves on the line to hire a younger person, I have debt this is what being an adult is I need to suck it up, and this is just a rough patch. She's mainly concerned with the money I make, and it always. comes. down. to. the. money. At this point, making less than 50k terrifies me because of how she has made me feel over the years. 

&#x200B;

I have been searching for jobs, and i can find other ones in other fields. I would be making above 50k, but not as much as I am now. I feel like I failed though. I got into my program, I was the head of the student side of things, I was the first to get a job, I graduated, I got my license. I did it, and I don't want to do it forever. I genuinely feel like I am doing something wrong, or I'm a bad person, for feeling this way. I want anything else, literally anything else.

I've never had a job that felt fulfilling.

I'm thinking that I will NEVER be 100% satisfied in a job because I'm not even sure what I absolutely love doing. And even if I do love doing it, how will I know Ill love it if I do it every single day? I also read a lot of others having the same issue (unfulfilling work/jobs) so it seems to be a common issue, perhaps unsolvable for some.

My SO thinks I put too much of an emphasis on getting all my ""satisfaction"" points from my career/job, when in reality I should think of my career as a way to get SOME satisfaction, mostly money, and look for the other satisfaction outside of work. For example, take my paycheck and learn new things, get new hobbies, etc. and get ""satisfaction"" points from that. Does that make sense?

So even though the role isn't 100% satisfying, I was good at the job, and I'm hoping to join a company that has amazing benefits, competitive pay, that will allow me the freedom of work/life balance and find satisfaction outside of work.

As someone who is VERY career-focused and driven, this is a huge shift in mindset and kind of scary to think of ""settling"" but I can see where he's coming from. I feel like this will solve some of my problems as I work on shifting my mindset to enjoying life outside of work and getting fulfillment that way.

I really wasn't expecting that. It's so hard to pick yourself up after being sacked when you worked so hard.

I suppose it doesn't help when your partner just graduated, got a graduate job and is undertaking a 2 year training scheme to find their strengths! Hopefully by the time new jobs pop up, I will be much quicker and more confident 🙂 I hope everyone has a great Christmas (I certainly need it)! 🎄

25: I graduated in 2016 with a degree in Landscape Architecture. I then worked with my father for a year because I needed some time back at home after uni (I had a difficult time with my mental health). In 2017 I worked at a practise for a year-out placement. I loved it. But I left after the year was up because one of my bosses was picking on me. And others for that matter (it was a toxic environment). I then did my masters which I really enjoyed. And it went downhill from there. 

This year I've had 3 different jobs. The first I left because of a very difficult boss (she kept calling me dumb and made a lot of personal comments). The second, I really enjoyed. But in June they sacked me for 'not meeting their standards'. I was working from home (covid lockdown) the entire time so one was able to support me/ help expand my skills. It turned out everyone I worked for was feeding back to the bosses I was 'too slow', but failed to tell me this themselves. It was a HUGE blow to my self esteem because it was totally out of the blue. I cried for weeks. I got a new job and the same thing happened. I'd even told my new boss that I was a little slow, but he used it against me. 

Just to note before I got sacked, no-one had mentioned my skills. It seems that companies aren't willing to train graduates anymore. I don't feel physically able to start a fifth job. I'm so anxious and unconfident at this point. I achieved a first in my masters, but the key software used in companies is very technical, and I naturally struggle. But I can use it. I'm just not as fast as others (who have worked in these companies for years thus have the experience). If they actually trained me and were patient, I'd be much faster by now. I don't get it.

I'm actually devasted. I loved Landscape Architecture, but I feel so let down. I don't know whether I've just been very unlucky or I'm really not good enough. Help :(",1607494076.0,2020-12-09 01:07:56

I apologies in advance for the word vomit, I'm quite dreadful at articulating my thoughts.

I hate always feeling so down on myself about where I am in life. I'm 30 still living at my parents house, living paycheck to paycheck. I have no marketable skills or any idea what direction I want to go. It seems like most people my age have a degree/career set, but I'm just here treading in place.

I have no idea what I want to, or could do for a career and I feel like my life is slipping me by while I'm stagnated trying to find something in passionate about and can make money doing.

I just feel like the world is passing me by while I idle in place. I just feel like a loser.

It seems like everyone my age has a Bachelors or Masters, a career, a house, etc. They knew what they wanted to do from high school or shortly after. I've never known. They say they 'stumbled' upon doing what they love.

I love cooking, and even tried to go to culinary school, but my stress and anxiety is so bad I cannot handle the pressure of working in a professional kitchen. I ended up in the hospital from all the stress I was under.

Other than that, I've never stumbled upon anything, I just go through life, one day at a time, going through the motions. I've never stumbled into anything and I feel like I missed a crucial step in my development as a young adult.

How the hell am I supposed to find what I love/can at least tolerate what I want to do for a living? outside of work all I do is sleep, eat, or listen to podcasts. I have no real friends or hobbies that can give me opportunities to stumble into something.

I just want enough to have my own place and be able to afford my insulin/food and maybe a few nice things like a workshop in the garage. other than that I dint care about money.

How do I commit to a path if I'm not sure if it will make me happy? How does one commit to something knowing there's a possibility things will end badly?  

How do I know what direction to start walking when every road looks the same from where I'm standing?

Sure get to the building an hour or 45 minutes early if you have no idea where you are going or are taking public transit. But don't go IN until MAXIMUM 20 minutes prior, ideally 10 minutes before, showing you are prompt but not overzealous.

And then if you DO go in early and the administrator/receptionist tells you it's in your best interest to take off and come back 10-15 minutes prior to your interview BELIEVE THEM! Sure you can wait there but you are going to look awkward as fuck and if it's a good place HR will ask that person what vibe they got off you. 'Arrived very early and then didn't trust my advice about the company I work for' isn't going to fly.

You don't have to go buy a coffee. Hell go wait in the lobby of another office building ( who cares if THEY think you are odd) but don't sit for 40+ minutes in the lobby of the company you want to work for.

Edit: okay I'm not going to respond to everyone or anything, y'all can read comment or the billion articles on this shit. If you have basic North American office rules and found a job without it then great for you. I too have arrived at the building of my interview an hour early ( public transit) and then gone elsewhere to wait. Honestly I expected like 3 upvotes or downvotes and then for this thread to die. I was just blowing off steam.

Here's the golden rule. If the administrator/receptionist tells you to make yourself scarce until x amount of time prior DO IT. They are VERY unlikely to have any interest in you failing and know their office better than you do, listen to them.",1563917239.0,2019-07-23 17:27:19
164,"Why do people assume just because you love a hobby (esp if you excel at it in amateur levels), that you will love doing it for a living? Has anyone found out how hard the pro leagues can be the hard way?",301,bztdbx,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/bztdbx/why_do_people_assume_just_because_you_love_a/,82,"We always hear stuff like ""follow your dreams!"" and the best recipe for successful wealth is ""pick something you love so much an make a career out of it!"".

And indeed you see to many people and not just kids and teens, but even adults, think that being a professional MMA fighter would be a fun job or assume just because you love eating cheeseburgers you can make a career at food eating contests, etc.

Recently I attempted to go pro at Magic The Gathering. I used to always beat my friends as well as other random people at bars and restaurants in betting matches and win big bucks. I won a small local tournament earlier this year so I decided I would go pro. But when I started this month I was getting my but whooped against even bottom tier ranking pro players and even amateur tournies that are above the ones I used to win at the local level. I practically lost all my gambling money and a large chunk of reserve cash I put specifically for this career on a rainy day.

In addition I never thought how stressful and hard stuff I used to do such as organizing my magic deck could be when your paycheck is dependent on it. And I'm so surprised how even the worst of the worst players at upper level amateur contests and professional gambling and dueling can be! Every trick I used that easily won me cash against friends and other people in my local neighborhood was easily countered and I could not develop any new strategy. In addition even just buying the equipment to keep up with the recent trends is extremely expensive.

So I am curious if anyone here ever tried to go pro at their favorite hobbies and backed out instead for an easy secure job or college like I did with Magic? Why do so many people especially commentators giving advice think that not only will you excel at something you love if you work at it for a living, but you will still easily stay in said career despite failures and setbacks simply because you love the job? 

Its repeated so often in the media and by commentators that you'd think its a guaranteed formula! But I learned first hand the hard way even the bottom levels of professionalism of your favorite hobby is so difficult you might end up hating the hobby (which I actually did with Magic after I decided to abandon pro gaming for almost a month until my sister convinced me to start playing with her again).

Has anyone here tried to go for the NBA or become a professional martial artist or played at esports as a pro gamer or other stuff you had a passion for as an amateur and backed out because of the shock of how hard a career is? Even going as far as temporarily abandoning the hobby because you grown to hate it for a while after attempting to go pro with it and seeing how much of a pain in the but doing your hobby is when you work at it for a living and not just for fun and games?

Please put your examples when you tried to go pro when you were younger!",1560385980.0,2019-06-12 20:33:00

Basically I had an epiphany yesterday, after I went the extra mile and busted my butt at my job for a project that turned out to not be worth the trouble. I'm on the east coast of the US, and one of our clients is in Alaska, so a four hour time difference. They told us a file had to be finished by the end of the day, so I decided to give up my plans for Friday night and bring my work laptop home so I could hop on as soon as I got an email from the client. But by the time their office closed at 9pm my time they hadn't gotten around to doing their end of things yet, so I had just wasted my evening for nothing. 

This type of thing is a pretty rare occurrence at my job, so this event is not a huge deal per se. I'm grateful I rarely have to take work home with me after hours. However, I just felt sort of disproportionately embarrassed and foolish for putting in that  much effort and giving up my plans for what turned out to be something less important than I thought it was. After some self reflection I realized I'm trying to somehow derive love and self-worth from my job, which is basically impossible in a corporate environment. I think it was drilled into me as a kid that my education was the most important thing, above social and other commitments, and I've just carried it over into my working life without realizing it.

I'm very grateful for my friends and family that give me social and emotional satisfaction, as well as my hobbies, but I guess I have still not come to terms that my job is just a job, not my life's calling, and doesn't give me much besides money and something to leave the house for. I guess basically my question is, how do you deal with the fact that your job isn't the center of your life? How do you begin to separate how you define yourself from how you spend the majority of your waking hours? Sorry if this is a little too philosophical or over-thinking things. I just haven't gotten it into my head yet that I can't just keep working harder until I earn self-esteem.

TL;DR: Just realized I'm stupidly trying to put in enough effort for a soulless corporate to love me and validate my existence somehow. Have others dealt with this epiphany, and how did you start to derive your self-worth elsewhere?

Where I work, they have a lot of free food around the office, which had allowed me to save A TON of money on groceries when I was working there as an intern, and now I don't have access to that anymore.

I'm a remote worker. I'm part of a remote worker team from an Asian country and my office is based in a well developed country. My work hours are 6 30 to 3 30. I started here nearly an year ago and when I first started a couple of other workers were working from a co-working space on selected days of the week. I joined them there for two days of the week, rest of my work was from home. This was pre-covid. The co-working space was paid for by my company and my husband travels the same way for work so I got dropped off at work too. Low travel expenses and less time traveling was such a plus for me cause I hate travelling. 

Fast forward to March, my company cancels their contract with the co-working space because they don't think it's safe for us to travel and be out of home for the next couple of months. I suspect this was a budget cut move too, not sure though. My husband started to work from home too starting March and will probably continue till end of the year. So from March to now we've been working from home. In March I was contacted by one of my friends for a job that was on part-time/freelancer basis and I applied and got this job too. This was remote work too. 

It's been about 4 months of 100% WFH and I feel like my quality of work has suffered. I feel disconnected and discouraged. I honestly don't feel like working and dread waking up to this everyday. I only work on things I must and I don't work on anything else that I used to do to ensure we generate good results. I only work on this when prompted to do so. I feel this way about both jobs. I'm not quite sure why but I think I need to go back to the co-working space. But that's out of the question because travel expenses + paying for co working space on my own adds up to  way too much. Husband and I have also thought of moving to a different country and I am so excited about that and super eager to start. Could this be another reason why I'm feeling this way about my job?

What do you guys think??


Edit:

I'm editing my post to summarize couple of suggestions/advice/points that I thought were very interesting hoping that this would help anyone else out there that feels the same way. All of these were brought up by users who commented below. Thank you strangers ♥️

- If it's possible for you to go to a co-working space or go to work maybe a few days a week, do it. The reason you want to continue WFH is probably because of its advantages ie: no commute, flexible schedule, etc. Buttt you might be missing being able to socialize (even without you realizing it). So getting that chance to interact with people would help if that's the case. 

- Have something playing in the background. Music might work for you, but it doesn't work for me. I listen to  ( not watch ) YouTube videos while I work. You need to find what works for you if you think this might be what's missing. 
This one is good I don't know why I haven't tried it before. It's weirdly good. It's weird, I think I like it because the video temporarily distracts me, which in turn reminds me to pay attention to work or most of the time I'm focusing so hard on work trying to ignore the background noise. It's weird, but it works. 

- Try rewarding yourself. Do 30 mins (or whatever works for you) of work and reward yourself with a short video or a couple of minutes of something else you like. I watch YouTube videos. 

- Schedule breaks. Walk. Stretch. Go out. Get some fresh air. Do something you like that's not work every 2 hours or so. 

- Try to create a clear boundary between your workspace and home space, so that you can walk out of the workspace after work hours. Working tends to seep into your normal life when WFH, and that's obviously not healthy.",1596546696.0,2020-08-04 09:11:36

Got a job as a driver with FedEx delivering packages.

Some events took place:
- truck accident during peak season causing a write off
- speeding ticket that happened outside of work, no convictions yet on this one. Still have another date in court to settle this
- tried to fight my case but eventually got my employment terminated at FedEx this year in January.

Covid 19 happened. Couldn’t find any other job and ended up working at a warehouse in Amazon.

Let me just say: I absolutely detest it here. No questions - the way everything is run at Amazon is a frustrating mess and it’s enough to drive me crazy almost every shift. They base my performance off something irrelevant (how many units can you stow per hour) and they have the most anal rules about it.

Good thing only about amazon: 4 days, 10 hours a week. I use the 3 days to practice coding (a friend recommended I try and I am pretty new to this) in hopes that I can eventually find employment in that in the near future. However it’s not easy and it takes some serious commitment. I try to practice to after work and I only end up falling asleep.

There are positions at amazon that are better but that depends on tenure. Although the pay for them is really not that much better, even compared with FedEx.

I have connections at FedEx and am looking to gain employment there again after getting my speeding ticket settled. I’m planning to work there full time and then practice code on the side until I get good enough.

I thought about just riding out Amazon until my court date comes close enough. What do you recommend I should do?",1594954655.0,2020-07-16 22:57:35

I am working on a project for my Direct boss and $NastyCoworker, to make their workflow in our system smoother. I followed the requirements, with only a few minor things that can get changed down the line as we continue to improve the system. My mistake: I didn't get the changes my boss and $NastyCoworker requested in writing.

Well $NastyCoworker didn't like the changes at all. Started up on a soap box about how she is never listened to and how I wasted all this time on changes that she didn't want. Basically saying openly in a meeting that I am incompetent. My boss basically tiptoed around her the entire meeting and once we got done with the meeting I called him directly and he agreed that she was off her rocker and I had made changes she wanted. He seems to think she has some bias against me because I am so much younger than her and in her eyes I am a kid. (I'm 3 years out of college). He then said he would speak with her about how ""This behavior cannot continue"", but I have already heard through the grapevine that it was the same old slap on the wrist with nothing actually being done.

Don’t get me wrong, I am so sad for how this virus has upended so many lives. But my company responded fast and told us to stay home starting in early March and since then I’ve had so much peace and contentment. 

Since working from home my professional and personal productivity has skyrocketed. I’ve been keeping up on work, starting a podcast, rebranding myself on social media, lost 20 lbs, read a few great books, used henna on my hair. With all of this good energy flowing, I’ve realized how draining it is for me to sit in an office all day. I enjoy my work but I’ve never liked being in an office all day long. It’s something that I dreaded earlier in my career and now I’ve just accepted it/gotten used to it. And I’ve tried to look for remote work before but couldn’t really find anything. 

This time has opened my eyes and I cannot go back to spending 40 in an office. I have no desire to do it. Prior to this covid crisis, the company reserved remote work for employees who had been w/the company 10+ years. It’s a family owned business and even one of the family members who had been there only a few years wasn’t allowed to work from home. But I’ve heard whispers that maybe they’ll see now that this is a possibility for us. I’ve been candid with my direct supervisor about wanting remote work. He wasn’t able to provide any information about where the company was at on the next reopening phase for us, but he seemed to understand. And I know many other colleagues feel like I do. 

My question is this:  is there anything I can do to move the needle on this? At this point it feels incredibly important for me to advocate for my needs.

Naturally, I'm focusing on establishing a career. I've always been interested in the concept of work. Ever since the end of high school, I've thought a lot about why people work and how to have a fulfilling career. This is easily the aspect of my life which I seem to value most, although this value comes from a sense of duty/social obligation rather than my own interest. So there's this question that's been bugging me for awhile.

As I explore different career paths people are pursuing, I can't help but notice that so many of them seem to be kind of... worthless. I make this statement with a lot of skepticism because I don't want to be judgmental with so little information. It's just that I notice so many problems happening in the world: hunger, disease, mental illness, violent crime, oppression, war, poor education, accidents, etc. However, few of these issues are directly effecting me. I live a comfortable life of abundance, security, and all the pleasures one could ask for. Some of this is a result of my own doing, as I enjoy rewards I have earned, but far more of it is just a result of circumstance. I was born in the USA, I'm intelligent, I'm able-bodied, I have a close family, I had access to relatively good education, to name a few of my blessings. But I earned none of this. I don't feel guilty for winning the lottery of circumstance, but I do feel guilty for not helping those who didn't. So here's my question: **is it morally wrong to pursue a career that primarily serves or benefits those on the higher end of the quality of life scale instead of dedicating one's life to solve the world's more severe problems?**

I realize that it's difficult to measure the value produced by, say, a film studio. What if someone is inspired by a movie and decides to travel to a third world country and build a school? But still, it seems that a film studio is just a bunch of people spending time, money, and energy playing with cameras and lights, like a game, when there's people in the world who don't have food. How about another example, a marketing firm that works with fashion brands to sell more expensive sunglasses? I mean seriously? You're working day in and day out to push pieces of plastic people wear on their face so they're a little more comfortable seeing outside? While people are dying of infections diseases because they don't have sanitation infrastructure? Or how about a business accountant? Crunching numbers to make sure you're getting the best tax return so that you can pay your dividends to shareholders so they can buy a new set of golf clubs to hit balls around on huge grass fields where homeless people would be kicked out for sleeping because they have nowhere else to go? I know my perspective is limited and ill informed, but there is truth to the basic concept: people spend resources solving comparatively minor problems when there are very serious issues affecting others in the world.

**What do you think about this? Is it morally wrong to not try to solve the world's biggest problems, if you have the ability to do so? If so, how might we change this about the world? How do we motivate people to create value where is more needed?**",1594509262.0,2020-07-11 19:14:22

I’ll try to summarize this, but I work in a high commission recruiting firm - placements typically earn you anywhere from $3,000-$12,000 Net commission - with that obviously comes a relatively low base salary. ($31,200 for the year)

I don’t want to do anything dumb because I’m new to my career and just graduated last May from college - but I quit my previous position at a 50k base to come here because the long term commission structure was so much higher.

Brief edit - the other recruiter works remote, there was no way to tell this candidate was spoken to because he didn’t follow policy.

 Me and a fellow co worker had spoken to a candidate however he had spoken to him a few hours prior and put him in for the position - however the employee did not follow any of the company policies. 

For anyone who has recruited you understand that the tracking system for candidates is huge to protect people’s work, I had actually qualified the candidate, gotten his updated resume, verified him, and added him to the system with him in my name and added notes. While the other worker briefly spoke to him, submitted him with an incorrect resume and was off the phone in 2 minutes. our company policy strictly states this means that it would go into my name because I had him in the database. because the other recruiter ignored all of this and the candidate had both of us submit him to the job (candidates can be sneaky like that sometimes)

Long story short the guy got the job and I’m looking at a $8500 commission minimum - but the owner is saying he might give it to the other employee because they’re friends and he’s been there for a while. The lead recruiter (my direct boss) is telling me how it’s not fair and if I wasn’t new then it would of at least been split 50-50. 

These placements take months to make, and I took a massive pay decrease to come to this company for this reason of high commission trades - but all my work is being stolen essentially in this instance, and I’m about to move closer to work in the next month or two so I don’t want to commit to a company if this is something which is going to constantly happen. 

Just want to hear your opinion on this because it’s going to bother me long terms and I genuinely cannot live off this base salary and dealing with student loans / rent at the same time when I can get a job with a 25-35% higher base salary in two weeks. My boss constantly is impressed with how hard I work and had fired 5 of the 11 recruiters in the office during the corona situation but kept me even though I was the newest - he texts me often to show his appreciation for my work and how it’ll all pay off soon - but then he goes and does this, it’s just hard to think past that.",1588453192.0,2020-05-02 16:59:52

A brief intro: I graduated University 5 years ago. Straight after uni I fell into a marketing job. It didn't pay well but it was ridiculously easy and stress free. It's the sort of job you should stay 1 year or so at. However I'm embarrassed to say I got comfortable with the ease of it and stayed at this job and am still there now (I wish I had left much sooner now). 

In my job the methods are at times old school and I could often get by by doing shortcuts and very little work. Because of this, I feel like my practical learning has stunted a little. Don't get me wrong, I have picked up some skills etc which I can carry forward but I feel less skilled than someone else with 5 years experience in the same field. 

Now, long overdue, I am applying for new jobs. The problem is, in the back of my mind I feel a bit anxious applying for jobs feeling ""what if I'm not up to scratch if I land a role"" especially since I have 5 years experience behind me. My CV and all are good, but it's just a feeling of what if I land the job and I completely suck. And this can often lead to me being too nervous to submit an application and I end up barely applying for any jobs each month.

To give you a quick background on my growth there I went from investigator, to quality control, to team lead, to client services, to IT Support, and now work in our implementation department.  I work an average of 400 overtime hours a year (I'm paid hourly) and consistently double the amount of required actions or tasks they expect of me in any week in any of these positions.  I really do love my company and I have proven I put in the work. That said it's made me a ball of stress, anxiety, and made me drink more than I'd like.  It gave me little free time to pursue my weightlifting and other passions.

We were always told our work is too sensitive in nature to do from home, but when COVID became serious, they finally gave us laptops or refurbished desktops and told us to leave.  I've been working from home since March, and we're not expected back until at least January, but I don't want to.  My stress levels have plummeted.  I sleep in more, I clock out and I'm home right away to go running or lift, I can do some small chores between tasks to clear up my night, etc. It's made me drink less and I'm just an all around better person emotionally.  Last night I had a nightmare they called me back to the office and I woke up in a panic.  I don't want to go back to the long commute, the cold office, deal with the cost of travel, etc.

I've been working on anything design branding and marketing for both print and digital however I've had no say in anything, that includes the copy content or often times how something should look. Reason being is that the COO thinks herself a marketer.

Now to give you a background she's a year 9 highschool drop out who started to date the CEO who made her the COO of the company. Because she finds marketing ""fun"" she constantly takes over my role and produces quite terrible work. 

She tells me I don't understand how ""academic"" think so I couldn't produce good work (I have multiple degrees, diploma, and certification). I find how she talks and does work honestly insulting to marketing and design industry to be quite honest let alone to the company as a whole.

The staff are kind and I'm happy with the pay but she drives me mental every.single.day. at 25 I'm happy to have someone wiser to teach me and guide me in bettering my skills but with her at the most, I'll just develop bad skills.

I decided to start looking for new jobs...lets just hope with COVID-19 I do find something but am I being immature? I know there's always someone or something in the company but after 6 months I can't imagine her to change and she'll obviously always be in the picture.

Just an update: I'd never quit without a job lined up and plenty of financial resources.
I'm from Australia, so health services is not really an issue and Covid-19 has not impacted us as badly.

The oldest person is 36. I’m the first mom they hired. I’m also not Protestant (lack the Protestant Work Ethic )& from a culture where sick days are more comMon. I’m about 6 months in. 

I caught a sinus infection about a month ago and called in sick one AM. My boss told me they NEEDED me for a meeting & could I take the next day off. Fine. I came in. 

The following day, I got a call at 9:30 that they couldn’t spare me & I needed to come in. I wouldn’t be docked sick time. 

This dance went on for about 3 weeks with my coworkers getting increasingly agitated. 

A week in, a single guy (my level)  confronted me in the kitchen, “I don’t want you in here breathing where people eat.”

I came back with, “You’re not my boss; you don’t own this company. If they keep cancelling my sick leave I will go anywhere in the office I please.” Not professional but I was so hurt & frustrated. 

Next day, a female (also my level) texted me: If you come in, I’m meeting with HR today to tell them you need to stop. 

Me: Please make that appointment; my boss keeps denying me sick leave. I’m no happier than you are. 

All the while I had people telling me to “stop being sick”, muttering “please stop” when I coughed, etc. 

Ultimately what broke the stand-off was I collapsed & ended up in the ER. A doctors note finally convinced my boss but HR made sure EVERYONE heard about it. 

By then, a couple others in the office had caught my bug. The Text lady caught it and a cycle of IVF didn’t work as a result. Another guy caught it & his wife lost one twin she was carrying. 

People were crying in the big conference room last Friday. On one hand, I feel terrible I got everyone sick... on another I’m kind of furious my boss kept ordering me in. It’s not all my fault but that’s how people appear to be framing it. 

I could have worn a mask & I need to live with that.  I should have been allowed to take sick leave though.

She wants to have a larger social media presence and so we hired someone to do that. Problem is that it  is creating additional work for me. Tons of additional work. To the point that I cannot get my other responsibilities done and it is causing me extreme stress. I havent gotten a pay raise in 2 years but got a promotion from hourly to salary in January and now all I do is work. 

When the pandemic hit they ""requested"" we use ALL our vacation time before the end of the 2nd quarter to help with the ""bottom line"" even though my company has already made budget this year. My boss did not make it sound like an option. I used the 2 weeks i had saved up. Now I need them more than ever. Also we are making money hand over fist in the pandemic and have NEVER been busier. We are slammed. My sales team that I support are running themselves in circles with orders.

Personally I also started doing Doordash  part-time on the weekends to help make some extra money since me and hubby need it with him not working like he was before covid. I make enough to support our bills but not our lives. 

But I am having nightmares. I cant keep up with the demands or the regular tasks I am supposed to be handling. Things are getting left behind. I am having nightmares. I cant work all the time but I am. I am tethered to my desk and phone at all times for work. I feel guilty going and doing anything. The Burnout  is so strong. I want to quit. But I am trying not to. I actually love my job when it isnt like this. I am invested in the people there and want to see it succeed.

We work well together and have for 7+ years and before she came along we knew when to take breaks. Now... and with being work from home and not in an office... i have no concept of a break.

Hi all,

For context: I'm a final year university student who will hopefully be 'graduating' this summer. I'm also currently applying for jobs, which is obviously not ideal in this climate.

I'm not dealing very well mental health wise with the current lockdown. I've got a few final university assignments to do, which I'm struggling to get done, but other than that I don't feel at all able to do... almost anything else. I'm seeking help etc. (I'll save you all the long details!), but I'm barely fulfilling the basic functions of a human being at the moment, let alone learning new skills, taking online courses, or generally working on my personal or professional development.

I'm worried that, over the coming months/year(s) I'm going to be asked about how I used this period to improve myself and make myself a better candidate, and that I'm not really going to be able to say anything. I can say that I was working on my university work, and that I've done a little bit of aid volunteering (it's an ad hoc kind of thing), but I reckon that lots of people feel more able to use this time to do lots of impressive stuff. That's how it feels among my peer group, anyway. I was already less than confident about getting a job after I graduated, but it would really suck if this was another blow.

I know that many of you are currently seeking employment/might work in recruitment etc., so I was just wondering what your thoughts were. Let me know if this is the wrong sub!

Thanks :)

Disclaimer: I fully realise that people have *far* *far* bigger problems to face, and that I'm in a pretty fortunate position.

—————
I just started a new job a couple of months ago and I’m having a hard time fitting in. It’s my first job out of school in a large company in the Midwest (USA) and I moved here from a North Carolina suburb. I am one of the youngest here. 

I’m a very outgoing person and was very excited to come to this position. I love learning about new people as well. I met with all kinds of people, introduced myself, asked them tons of questions, and tried my best to start conversations. 

But that’s not reciprocated. I often don’t get told good morning (I get no one OWES me this but it’s a bummer), I get ignored in meetings, and no one wants to hold a conversation with me about even the most mundane things. My emails get ignored sometimes too even by those within my function. For the email thing, I probably need to earn my place or something, but it’s compounded by all the other things I’ve been experiencing. 

A couple of examples:

My function had a group call and I asked them what they’ve had for breakfast just to fill the pre-meeting silence and got nothing back. Another person came on and they were willing to talk to them about their mundane question. So I didn’t bother saying anything else and it has made me stop going into meetings too early. 

I went to a team building lunch and no one spoke to me despite me asking them questions about themselves and trying to connect on what they’re talking about. At a table of four, I sat with two other new people and one seasoned employee. One new person asked everyone but me what brought them to the company. I asked her but no one reciprocated. Things like that happened throughout the lunch. I just stopped talking.

It’s honestly made me withdraw into myself and kind of killed my desire to be outgoing. I feel very alone and that no one really wants me there or wants to get to know me. I just sit in these meetings, introduce myself and people say “hi” and nothing else. So I’ve kind of stopped trying.

I know it’s important to be strong and hold out, especially in new positions, but I thrive off of team work and some sort of camraderie. 

It’s probably hard to gauge just from a post on reddit but any suggestions on how I can connect with my team and business partners? What sort of things am I doing wrong? What can I do to improve? Maybe I’m just reading into it incorrectly. I don’t know. I honestly feel like maybe the Midwest isn’t for me...",1586990970.0,2020-04-15 18:49:30

I don't want to give up because I was given this opportunity so I better make the most of it. Any advice on how to move onward and upward when you're feeling survivors guilt and imposterish, would be very helpful.

The company I work for was just cut exactly in half. In a small company that feels really personal and not to mention we're in a fairly small town where everyone knows everyone. 

I was fairly new, and although I recently was getting over my imposter syndrome for being new and young. It came back full force right after ""mourning"" the loss of co-workers that I admired and that I felt were very hard-working. 

My job hasn't changed much since I am the only person who was doing my particular jobs and I had already been covering for another employee who was often absent for the past year or so. In fact my job has been a lot slower since people were let go.

Because of this I am panicking a little because of the lack of immediate fires to put out. And knowing that other people have massive new fires I was trying to streamline some of our processes to make life easier for others, but I may have frustrated them more. 

I feel guilty for still having my job. I feel guilty for not having a bunch of new responsibilities (yet). I know I have been working hard to make this workplace better and have been pretty well appreciated by management, but I can't help but feel guilty about others who loved their jobs losing them. And I'm feeling unreasonably useless right now. I know better, but I can't help but feel it and I am struggling to power through.

TLDR: I have a job even though our company downsized by half. Im struggling to move forward because I feel guilty and like an imposter.

I was fired from my most recent company for, well...that's up for debate. My tenure there was almost two years. My supervisor laid out the following when I was fired. I am paraphrasing:

\- the company is going through structural changes.

\- we don't see you as part of those plans as the company moves forward.

\- in addition to the above, your performance has played a role in this decision.

\- we are providing you a severance package.

As far as my performance goes, I was given a written warning, and then a week later I was told I was performing as expected, so all good. It clearly wasn't worth firing me over, however, in hindsight, I do see political reasons why the previous events took place and are not worth getting into here.

What I am looking for is advice for explaining the above to new employers. While I was fired, this does seem like I can spin it as a layoff given the structural changes at the company and the severance package, while omitting anything related to performance. I am just not quite sure how to phrase it right.

For what it's worth, my previous employer is not supposed to provide any details to references beyond my start and end dates and title, according to the severance agreement.

During my last year of university, I received a generous job offer working in Florida for an 80k salary with an 8k signing bonus, benefits, and up to 10% performance bonus. However, since coronavirus hit, that job’s start date was put up in the air because the industry was hit moderately hard by COVID. It was originally intended to start in July. 

Back in May, my boss contacted me and told me that I had the option to start in July but to start at $15/hour and that they couldn’t give me the offer originally given to me until a later time. I didn’t have any other offers still available so I took it. 

So I’ve been working for a few weeks and I keep following up with my boss about when they think they’ll be able to give me the original offer. He answers with uncertainty (understandable, he can’t predict COVID and the economic situation). He says maybe September but still can’t give a solid response. I’ve asked for some sign that they’re actually going to fulfill their offer by giving some bonus or higher pay closer to what they offered. He answered with it’s probably not possible and that it was hard enough to get the new hires hired at $15/hour during COVID. 

My parents think that they will continue paying $15/hour and use COVID as an opportunity to get me and a couple other new hires as cheap labor. (We all have STEM degrees and some of us have graduate STEM degrees)

The employer’s perspective is we gave you the option to work for $15/hour so it was your choice to take it and we were giving that as an option so that people could meet financial obligations if necessary or for visa reasons. 

I understand times are tough right now and I’m lucky to even still have a job, so I don’t want to seem ungrateful but I’m trying to look out for my best interest and can’t tell what my employer’s intentions are. 

I’ve been applying to other jobs but I doubt I will be able to find something that matches what they had offered. I’m interviewing for a position that I think pays around 70k. If I get the offer, I think I’m going to take it. I will hopefully leave the current workplace on good terms so that if the current employer is serious about trying to get us the original offer, they may still reach out and let me know later on. 

Please let me know thoughts and advice on the situation.

How do I stay sane at a traditional job that makes me miserable?",258,hv7esn,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hv7esn/how_do_i_build_towards_a_financially_stable/,57,"I always knew I wanted to become an author. I didn't have a happy or loving childhood so I read books to escape from the reality of life. This led to my love for fantasy writing. 

My family came from a low socioeconomic background. They worked tirelessly to make ends meet. I knew growing up, I had to become the bread winner, which meant I couldn't chase after my dream to write. Due to how my family grew up, they don't believe creative careers can be financially sustaining. 

Most of my career, I industry hopped, trying to figure out a way to make income without hating what I did. I ended up in marketing. Now, I work at a startup, making decent money. I have an emergency fund and I have investments. I'm able to provide and take care of my family because of how much I make.

During quarantine, I've been able to write more, but my job takes a lot of energy and time and I find myself drained and unhappy on workdays. I know I should feel grateful that I have a job and that I have income, but I feel trapped. The company I work for has changed drastically in culture and in people since I joined. 

I came to realize that the traditional route of work is not where I see my future. I have been thinking of alternative ways to make income, where my schedule can be flexible and I'm working on projects that I genuinely enjoy.

I'm at a crossroads as to what to do next. The following next steps have been on my mind:

* **Continue to advance programming and data analytical skills** 
   * I enjoy learning these skills, but do not enjoy using them within a company setting
   * This will be a huge time commitment. Primarily to excel in my marketing career and also to become more attractive as I interview for new roles.
   * Motive is to make more money.
* **Apply for new jobs**
   * Job applications and interviewing prep has taken up a majority of my time after work.
   * Motive is to make more money and advance in the traditional sense
   * I'm afraid that in another two years, I'll dislike my job again and find myself back in this situation. I know this is a short term goal to get out of my current situation, but I also don't want to continue to stay in this ""get job, hate, job, get new job, hate new job"" cycle. 
* **Pursue non-traditional income routes (Amazon FBA, Etsy, YouTube, etc.)**
   * Have not researched or worked towards this at all, but thinking this could give me additional income that would give me enough leverage to transition away from the traditional career route. Most likely will take months or years to see any profit.
   * Interested in pursuing more entrepreneurial ways to sustain my living situation. Interested in exploring and trying out new projects outside of work 
   * Motive is to make money and learn new skills.
* **Write my novel series**
   * Working on my novel; however, the writing process is slow. Will likely take years to draft, edit, and publish.
   * I enjoy writing and this is ultimately my life goal
   * I don't want to die and regret never having pursued this fully.

As you can tell, my mind is all over the place. I want to pursue each of these solutions in varying degrees, but then I stop myself because I feel like I'm wasting time and energy if I choose one route over the other. 

I have been able to ignore creative pursuits in order to make steady income to take care of my family and myself, but the longer I go down the traditional career route, the more unhappy I become. It's always been a struggle to choose between financial stability and creative pursuits. And honestly, **I'm afraid**. I'm afraid to pursue non-traditional careers, like writing, in case it blows back on my family, but I also feel suppressed, like I can't live into who I was meant to be.

I've had multiple family pass away in the last year and hearing the news every day about people dying from coronavirus has made life feel shorter and more precious. 

I really don't know what the best route is. My indecisiveness has been draining my mental energy. I know I need to decide and commit. Should I just suck it up and work off-hours to pursue other ventures? My day-to-day has become unbearable and I find myself angry or irritated at every request and process at work, but the job market isn't great. I haven't been able to get any new offers yet.

I’m not an overachiever by any means but I am a jack of all trades. I can do a little bit of everything and I am very conscientious. My senior manager quickly realized this and kept praising my results and my work ethic. However, he slowly but surely began to use me more as an assistant than a junior manager. The more tasks I offered to do the more tasks I’d end up getting. Worst of all, as time went on I wouldn’t even be thanked for doing tasks I wasn’t originally meant to do. It would just become “normal” that I would do everything. When business cards were ordered for me, they actually said “assistant” and not “junior manager”. I was kind of pissed but since I wasn’t planning to stay at this company for long, I just swallowed it and thought whatever. I ended up staying almost 5 years and looking back, I often regretted not having stood up for myself. I liked my manager and because of it, I let myself be maneuvered into a position where I was doing more of his work than I had been hired to do. It got so bad that when he decided to go back to university, I’d sometimes end up doing tasks that were obviously for his courses. But because they were vaguely related to the business, I never dared to complain about it. 

Now I’m about to start a new job, better pay, better hours. Needless to say my old manager is pretty upset about this. I guess karma really is a b*tch because since he kept downplaying my role and taking credit for my work, he’s not getting a replacement for me and is not happy about it. But I digress.

I have no direct manager at this new job as I will be my own department. I only need to take orders from the CEO. Now here’s where it gets complicated: I have a fixed term contract for a year. If they like me they’ll keep me. So naturally I want to do a good job and prove to them that I’m an asset worth keeping. But I also don’t want to repeat the mistakes I made at my old job. I don’t want to overwork myself trying to prove my worth because now I know from experience that after a while, it just becomes “normal” and I get no thanks for it, just more tasks. There is an example that I’ve been wondering about and illustrates this dilemma. 

I’ll be in charge of the newsletter. My new company is already putting me in CC of certain emails and I saw two things:
1. They are outsourcing a big chunk of their online presence to the company that made their website.
2. They aren’t entirely satisfied with the results. 
More specifically, they needed to have some text changed in the newsletter template and the company that did the website is going to implement these changes. Now I saw that the newsletter is done with MailChimp and I have worked with MailChimp at my last job and so I was thinking about how when I’ll start, I’d rather ask to be given the login so I can make the changes I want myself, without having to ask someone to implement them. But I’m also a little worried that this is how it starts and that if I do tasks that I’m not expected to be doing, I’ll soon be overworking myself again...

So I’m looking for advice. How much of my skillset should I show right from the beginning? Should I be open about all of the skills that I have? Or should I just do what I’m asked to do well and no more?

If I didn't have to work I wouldn't. I have never gotten any satisfaction from working, I have simply done it to keep a roof over my head.

I moved across the country at 20 years old (2008 by the way) and realized ""Life is hard when you're the one paying for it""  
Ended up in a bartending job because it was a way to make enough money to pay my bills and have some money left over for the actual enjoyable part of life.

Fast forward 11 years (31 now) and I'm still bartending. Where I'm working pays really well but I swear I'm dying on the inside. 

The problem is that I genuinely don't know how else to make a living out here. I live in CA and I can not reasonably afford to rent a place of my own (51% of my income just to cover the $1700 rent for a studio or maybe 1 bedroom if you're lucky) *with* my good paying bar job, so what else is there?

Am I missing something? Nothing really calls to me for a job, so is this it? Do I just bartend so that I have something to make an income off of for the rest of my life and just kinda die inside? There's no job that's calling to me. Hobbies and passions sure, but they require money to do anyway and you don't get paid to do them. Not as inexperienced as I am either.

What should I do?,251,hrptg7,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/hrptg7/i_have_made_a_huge_mistake_and_switched_to_a_new/,37,"A few months ago I was contacted by a head hunter for a job with a much higher salary in a very prominente company, better benefits and lots of flexibility.  
At this point, I was employed for 2,5 years in a fairly good company, which had its problems, but I could deal with them. They didn't pay very well, though, but I had lots of flexibility, a great team and super interesting projects.  
At the same time I was contacted by this head hunter, I was going through the selection process to my dream job and I had made it until the last phase where it was just me or another person.    
So, I had 2 very good opportunities on the table: my dream job and the other job which was better. I decided it was safe to quit.  
As you may imagine, I was not selected for my dream job. So I was left with a very good job offer, which was ok for me. I took it and here I am, 2 months later.  
My mistake was that I was so convinced I was going to get the dream job that I didn't pay attention to the signs in my interactions with my current employer that this was bad, nor did I dedicate any effort to get to know a bit more of the company.   
This new company is absolutely the worst. They literally lied in the interviews about the company’s working culture, their stance about flexibility and even about some aspects of my contract.  
I got in the company in the middle of a HUGE crisis where I immediately took a ton of responsibility and I felt it would not be correct for my colleagues if I quit during my experience period and leave them with all of this by themselves. 2 of them are really great, one of them actually quit last week. The company has a huge turnover, as you can imagine.  
I am finding out more and more horrific things about this company every day. My boss is a hypocrite, liar, has no empathy, treats women poorly, and everything revolves around him and how brilliant he is. Overall a sick narcissist. Last year alone, 2 people had burnouts and 1 had a stroke after working 4 days without sleeping.  
I worked 2 national holidays and 1 full weekend, plus a million extra hours for an event, which I would not do in a normal situation, but everything was very badly managed and if I didn’t, nothing would work. The day after the event I was told we could take one day off (which is not enough either way), so I took it, but apparently it just meant that instead of arriving at 9:30 I could arrive at 10:00. And this is not even a joke or me exaggerating.  
I’m not going to rant anymore, but many other very horrible things have happened and I honestly don’t know what to do. There should be an economic crisis coming up and I’m not sure I can just quit without anything lined-up. I don’t want to be unemployed when it hits. I have applied to 3 jobs so far that I’m waiting for an answer. 1 of them with people I know and who really appreciate my job, another one for a position that I’m 100% qualified, and another one that actually I will not take at all even if I’m selected because it is not very interesting. In addition, I have a volunteer project writing articles in my area for a think tank and I would like to take a programming bootcamp.  
I was absolutely naïve and I didn’t even make an effort to try to research about them, I know this is my fault. I never thought this was ever a possible scenario. But I just feel that coming here every day is doing a number on my mental health. I absolutely HATE being here and I’m actually scared that they can screw up my career if I stay longer. I’ve heard stories.  
Should I just quit? Should I suck it up and train my resilience skills?

I started a new job mid April. Everything was going great for the first month until another employee Karen* came back from covid lockdown. She didn’t like the way I did things and began berating me in front of everyone. I told my boss it made me uncomfortable and he said he would talk to her, but he totally folded, which reinforced her shitty behavior. Knowing he couldn’t help me I just tried to keep my mouth shut and ignore it.

She continued making me uncomfortable (yelling at me when things were wrong but also not training me to do it the “right way” beforehand) and I think another coworker noticed. He told my boss’ boss (the owner) I was overwhelmed and getting no help from Karen*. 

The owner to me in his office to talk. He asked what was going on and I said “I do not feel supported by Karen” to which he said “you are not supported by her.” Um, ok???? Wow love to work on a team that doesn’t support you. He went on to say “look we all hate Karen. She does this to everyone and several people have left bc of her. She causes drama and she does her work wrong half the time. But her bark is worse than her bite, it’s just a social learning curve you have to get used to. Just ignore her.” Um, no???? I work directly next to this woman that shits on everything I do and this is the best you can offer? She is directly ahead of me in the work flow how am I supposed to ignore or avoid her. He then tells me, “you’ll learn I have a fear of firing people. I hired Beth* bc she said she was bitchy enough to put Karen in her place, but now they’re buddies. So I’m hoping you can own that work area and run her out of here.” What the fuck??? Lol 

There are a lot of other hairy details I’m leaving out for the sake of hoping someone will read this. They warned me in the interview there would be drama. Red flag!! I feel like I’m being gaslit at this new job and I just want to quit. Before this I was working as a receptionist (earning only a dollar less than doing skilled labor) and they would take me back in a heartbeat. I’m leaving work every day stressed as hell, stomach in knots, and no energy to better myself or find a new job to get out of this situation. Reddit, What do I do??

I received a call today to say that I basically had the position (pending reference checks) as the CEO of their company called off the recruitment freeze. 

I’m super happy about this as it’s exactly what I wanted before isolation began - the role is way more pay, in an industry im passionate about and close to home - but now I’m in an awkward position where I’m probably going to have to resign via email or zoom from my current employer.

I work in public health and this is a report for one of the counties we work with.

Leadership knew of this project for over half a year but didn’t know what to do with it, and sat on it until about a month ago. Then comes their idea, a data dump and a goal of having a polished report on this county with all this data in 3 weeks. 

I can do it, but it takes a lot of hours. And since I’m salary, I can’t really complain too much about hours worked, but when is it too much? Is 80 hrs a week for the past month too much? If I had one more month I could do this easily. 

I never want this to happen again, advice? 

If I had reigns on the project earlier I’d be able to delegate efficiently and use my strengths on the report accordingly. An extra month would’ve done it. 

I have one on one meets with my direct supervisor every other month, should I bring it up then? One coworker said sure but be cautious since I’m salary and I don’t want to make it seem like I’m ungrateful or something like that.

Lately I have been experiencing anxiety and panic attacks at night while I think about the future. I graduated from university exactly 2 years ago, and I have been unemployed and lost ever since. In college I was initially a business major with plans to specialize in sports business (sports are by far my biggest passion). After taking and struggling with the required classes such as Accounting, I did not meet the requirements to make it into the business school. With my business degree chances evaporated I changed majors and graduated with a more generic economics/business/sociology type degree with a minor in media studies.

As graduation approached I still had no answer to the classic question of “so what are you going to do next?”. I still love sports business but that field seems incredibly cutthroat and unstable. As an introverted guy I would really not fit in with that style of super social and outgoing personality to have success in that field. At this point in my life I feel just completely overwhelmed. The thought of a 9-5 job that I don’t enjoy makes me sick to my stomach just imagining it. My resume is barren and the more time that goes by the worse it will be. I have been studying for an IT certification but have made little progress. It makes me incredibly disappointed in myself that I can’t even get myself to study anymore. After 2 years of doing nothing I feel like I have snuffed out any flame of ambition I once had. I dread holidays and get anxious thinking about how I’m going to answer when family and strangers ask me “what do you do?”.

I know this is more of a rant but I felt like I needed to get some of this off my chest and see if anyone here has battled through a similar period in their life.

My main passions are sports, film, animals/environmental justice, poker (I love game theory and statistics).

He agreed and seemed understanding but I had to stay with finance until a big project I was involved with was done (beginning April). I was happy!

Then pandemic happened... all that big project (the yearly budget) became void and I got furloughed. They were apologetic and I have since filed for unemployment and I’m home waiting to get a call back (and living my best life tbh). However, a good friend who’s a coworker in that accounting department gave his notice two weeks ago, and suggested me reach out to them to try and get back to the accounting department (remember, the CFO back in January promised me). I didn’t and now I found out that the company posted a google ad and on their website that they’re hiring for such position in accounting ON THE DAY MY COWORKER GAVE HIS NOTICE!!!! KILL ME!

I feel pretty hurt that they didn’t consider me back - kinda feels like they just wanted to get rid of me, and found an excuse. I excelled at my accounting job, and looks like the other ppl who got furloughed were all notably incompetent ppl. 

I need advice... should I reach out to the cfo who promised me the job and ask what’s up? Or should I let it go and wait/start looking for another job?

However, my job title is quite impressive in the context of my career development over the last decade.

But I simply can't take this anymore. The stress is taking over my life, I've been having nightmares recently about my work. I'm not able to save any money at all... This job is good for my career but bad for my life.

I know I need to find new employment, but to find something that would take advantage of this experience would probably take a while. And I don't have a while, I can't wait anymore I feel like I'm on the edge of something bad if I keep trying to put up with my current situation.

My question is, would I be crazy to quit and take a job that doesn't take advantage of this recent experience? 

To be specific, I know I can get a job working as a front desk attendant at a hotel. It would be much less stressful, I would be full-time so I would have a decent pay, health insurance, vacation time, etc.

But would this derail my career? If I did want to come back to the pensions industry with this sort of be a black mark for me? should I just suck it up and try to deal with my current situation for the next few months until I can find a role that would be in a related industry and that at least would be a lateral move??

I have 2 incomplete degrees that I abandoned years ago because I didn't need them for freelancing (MA about 90% completed, BA about 50%). 

Now I need a way to support myself and I'm trying to finally set up something that will work for me in the long run. My freelancer profile is probably my best asset with a 100% client satisfaction score and some great written feedback. I never knew it would be so useless when trying to find employment. 

The thing is, I want to quit freelancing. For me, it's always been too much effort for an unbalanced work life and little money. I definitely never enjoyed the constant race for new clients either. Some of this is probably my fault.

I also want to step away from editing. I'm a decent editor, but not some great talent, and I no longer enjoy doing it. This is partly because of the nature of freelancing and partly because I find most of my projects unfulfilling and meaningless. I did have some good, long-term clients, but not enough to be able to refuse crappy ones.

My aim is to establish a simple, ""normal"" adult life with a job that pays the bills and has fixed work hours. At this point, I don't even care if it's boring, I just want to be financially balanced, not having to work (chase new clients) to be able to work, and have a couple of hours to myself after I've finished work.

But I'm not sure it's possible to make this transition without solid work experience and education on my resume. I'm worried that I'm too old, my work experience is not enough, and generally not sure how to go about it. 

Do you have any advice for me? Courses I should take that would make me marketable in a short period of time?

I'm actually not some lowlife, I just need someone to give me a break. I work hard, learn fast, and I'm responsible. I've always worked remotely and would like to keep it that way. I was looking at jobs like content moderation and customer support roles where they don't necessarily ask for relevant experience. But there might be other options, I just really never learned how to do a proper job search. Any advice is appreciated!

summary: I found a job that checked off everything on my 'ideal job list' but lots of factors like bad management and rude clients are making me want to quit.

For backstory, I am currently taking a gap year in university and I wanted a part time or casual job but after a bad job experience the year before, i had a checklist. I wanted to be able to work alone, not have to deal with any customers, something fairly active and basically not have to speak to anybody all day. Unexpectedly, I found a job that checked all those boxes with the added plus of being paid above minimum wage (it is a job in housekeeping). However, I find that as time goes on, my boss has me taking on more and more work to the point where I am overbooked with full time hours (even though i have demanded multiple times to only be booked part time) and can not do a good job because i am expected to get too much done in one day. We are also understaffed by 3-5 people (it is a very small company) and for some reason, I am the only employee that is being given all the extra jobs. I have talked to my boss multiple times about the problems with scheduling but she rarely listens. There is also the point of being seen as less than human by these rich snooty clients who think I only exist to do work for them (typical customers). However, the complaints and the stress from my schedule is making me want to quit. I have a lot of outside commitments and hobbies that I now never have time for and its making me hate my job even more. I need the money and i can’t go back to a retail job or i will go insane. Has anybody else been in a situation like this? what did you do? I know somebody will say ""just quit"" so i would love some advice from somebody who knows that its not that simple.",1606476595.0,2020-11-27 06:29:55

I’m 32 and had a stroke November last year, which took away my speech. I had to relearn how to speak starting with the abc. Today marks five months since my stoke and I have recovered roughly 75%. I still find it difficult to get out some complex words, joining words (like ‘and’ and ‘an’), and my sentences sometimes have slight gaps between words. Sometimes I speak perfectly, but I’m slower than I once was but I’m getting there! They say it’s takes several months to a year to heal the brain after a stoke. I’m have youth on my side. 

Before I had my stroke, I was travelling the world for six months. I got made redundant in March 2019 from my finance role, where I analysed companies (shares) and the economy for a living for six years writing a newsletter for a global publishing company. All up I have roughly 7-8 year experience in the financial industry. But I wasn’t able to break into a big fund or broking firm, so I was severely underpaid (~$80k) by industry standards of $150k+. But I have the interesting and competitive experience for finance, I guess.

My concern is that I have over a years gap on my CV....now with the corona virus and businesses not advertising for jobs. Then again, if this event didn’t happen, I still wouldn’t feel ready because of my speech - it will be hard to sell myself now. I’m thinking of giving myself until the end of the year to hopefully recover, and, by then hopefully the economy will be reopened and companies hiring again. 

To cut a long story short, I’ll probably be out of the work force for nearly 2 years because of my stroke and the economic shutdown before I apply to jobs...if I start applying at the start of next year. 

I have always wanted to give tech sales a crack, but that depends obviously on my speech and how much it recovers - I’ll need to sell myself to land a job and I can only do that if I’m 99% better. I feel hopeful about it though. But I don’t know what I will look like in 3-6 months. If not, I will probably go back into finance becuase I’ll have no choice. That said, I’m just concerned about my possible 2 year gap. 

Do you think I’m screwed and have anyone changed careers in their 30s, or got a professional job with a long gap on their CV?",1587256511.0,2020-04-18 20:35:11

After graduating from college I wasn’t getting anywhere due to lack of experience.  I somehow lucked into my current job at an early stage startup where I got given a chance. My boss (CEO) seemed nice and friendly, and first few weeks seemed fine enough that I thought this could be a place I could grow into. We had lunches together and talked about the kind of work to be done and expectations of support I will need.

But then suddenly, my boss’s attitude changed and he started swearing a lot and becoming abusive. I think this coincided with the CTO resigning. So because we became short staffed, my boss started throwing work at me which I was completely unqualified for. He also casually blackmails me saying “he’ll destroy my career if I don’t deliver on my work” or “ruin my life in ways I haven’t even thought of”. After I barely manage to scrape through a deliverable, he suddenly becomes friendly again. 

For my next deliverable, I’ve already been sent work to do over the weekend and honestly I am completely out of my depth... I would normally do as I am told, but the fact is, I am too slow. I am just a novice programmer and I’m expected to produce the work of someone with 10 experience with no support.

Despite this, I've been repeatedly chewed out by my boss because the junior team members complete more of a few specific kind of tasks than I do in a shift.

To me this seems ridiculous. It's like asking a manager of a coffee shop why they aren't making as many cups of coffee as the baristas. During shifts I'm the sole go-to person for people from other departments (there's a lot of back and forth) and in charge of overseeing operations, and deciding which tasks are priorities and which aren't, and doing final QC checks. Even to get all of that done I usually end up working 10-12 hour days, and it's still not enough.

My boss just won't listen when I explain how overworked I am. He has very specific ideas about how long certain tasks ""should"" take, right down to the second. He's mapped out my shifts according to these increments of time that he's decided constitute how long each task should take and it all adds up to 8 hours, therefore he thinks there shouldn't be a problem. There's no accounting for the fact that switching tasks every few minutes makes a dent in focus and productivity.

For example, one of the tasks that he's tacked onto my job is running social media. I'm supposed to post to Twitter 30 times a day with accompanying images, gifs etc. and he says that this should be easy because ""it only takes a few seconds."" But crafting a tweet that's witty and engaging and corporate-friendly takes more than just a few seconds, and interrupting my day to do it 30 times is really disruptive.

With everything that I'm expected to do, mistakes are inevitably made and things slip through the cracks. I've been reprimanded for mistakes many times and every single time I tell him the same thing: I have too much stuff to do. And nothing changes. If anything, more work just gets added to the list.

Twice in a row I've had other professors barge in my class and tell me to turn down the volume of the video clip we're watching because it was distracting their class next door. Yet both times, they refused to close their classroom doors and always blasted the volume to their videos so loud our classroom could hear it very clearly while I was instructing. My students remarked at the hypocrisy of the instructor to make such a request. 

Today I had an older professor come into my classroom that she normally uses and exclaim, ""Who are YOU?"" in front of my students during class. She was upset that I happened to be using a classroom that is ""hers"" yet college classrooms are like free real estate. They aren't designated to any one person.

Male, 33. I have very limited work experience. Due to mental illness I was in care for the majority of my  teens and 20s, but I am better now, and started at my current workplace when I was 30. I dropped out of school in 7th grade and have not completed anything beyond this level. I got the job essentially by going around to every business begging them to give me a shot despite my inexperience.  


I got promoted to supervisor about 18 months in, and then again promoted in December to co-assistant manager. The money is good, the business is doing great and the benefits are ridiculous. On paper, it's all good. It's also where I met my wife.   


But I pretty much dread going to work every day. And I am so happy on the drive home. I feel like I am being judged too harshly because of my past. I've had five sick days and two personal days off (one funeral and one wedding) since I started here; every time I do, there's some vague hinting about me possibly struggling mentally again. I am anxious around my boss and terrified of making mistakes. I feel like I am under constant scrutiny.  


So, this past Thursday, the owner called me into his office. Three of my colleagues are retiring within the next 12 months, and he wants to restructure the business in way that would give me more responsibility, and obviously an even higher salary. In theory good news, but it's stressing me out so much. He also, again, vaguely mentioned something about my past. Can't remember verbatim, but the essence of it was ""I want you to do this if you show me that you're mentally stable enough"". I've never been away from work because of my mental health. I haven't even taken an extra break in the years I've been there.  


I don't feel like I have any control or power. My resumé is literally nothing besides this job. If I lose this job or somehow fall out of favour I am afraid that I'll have to start at the bottom somewhere else, if I can even get a job. If I turn down this promotion, I feel like it'll add even more pressure on me and lead to even more doubts about my mental health. Every day feels like a new trial period.

I can typically turn on the charm when I have to, like for a client or for an interview. But I’m more of a quiet reserved person. 

It doesn’t necessarily hold me back professionally, such as I still make and exceed my sales goals, I am very quick to learn new skills, I am patient and calm with clients and can turn around a bad situation by being nice and “sweet”

But it does hold me back in the social aspect of my business life. Some example of this are I have trouble networking and making connections. I don’t make friends easily at the office (6 months in I’m loved by everyone, but up until then I get a lot of heat. They don’t understand why the quiet girl is doing so well and the loud people are just doing ok). I once had a boss call a meeting with me just tell me the thing she hated about me most was that I was shy. I asked her if she thought I wasn’t doing my work well, she said it was all great but she didn’t like that I wasn’t loud and chatty like her. I could understand if a client said something, but I didn’t work with clients at that point, I did research for her. 

I learn by listening and observing, then trying and then asking questions along the way. I’ve had employers tell me that if I’m not asking questions while learning, I’m not paying attention. So then I end up thinking of questions I don’t really need to ask just to appease them by asking *something* and they point this out as a negative also.

My current job sucks, and while I'm applying for new ones each day, it's becoming harder and harder not to get in trouble at work. What do you do?

Ive been there a few months, and it just seems the training and expectations are just not workable. They give you only a few days of training before being expected to cover someone for a couple weeks, and it just doesn't cover enough. 

Ive tried checking in each hour with my boss, it doesn't work, im still told im ""doing great"" until something goes wrong and then I'm somehow blamed. The tasks are just too hard, and there's too much disconnect with expectations vs. reality for me. I've tried logging my times for each task, but there's so many little things that can randomly turn into extremely urgent problems, it's hard to keep an accurate log. 

I get home each day and im exhausted and feel overwhelmed. Im past trying to work out these issues, but I need to avoid getting written up or fired before I leave. What do you do?",1607438879.0,2020-12-08 09:47:59

I’ve confirmed a tertiary interview with one, and was promised a decision by the end of this week from the other.

The tertiary interview I’m heading for next week is my dream job at this point in my career. I’d be managing an entire department consisting of multiple teams — it’s a big jump from the quasi-managerial roles I’ve had previously, the office environment is amazing, they’re in a big growth mode — everything about it is extremely exciting. But I don’t have a car and public transportation in my area is lacking, so it’s a bitch to get to considering it’s out in the suburbs.

The other I’m hoping for an offer from is a quick, free city bus ride away, or I could even walk there if I really wanted to... but it’s more of a lateral move, the company is in a niche industry and not expanding much, but the office is still a very cool environment, so I feel like I’d be happy there.

So, I’m curious what this sub has to say — would you rather take a really good job that’s a bitch to get to, or wipe out the commute for something less enticing?

EDIT: After reading the responses, I’m realizing I’d rather take the commute for the career jump. Commutes don’t bother me, work is life at this stage, and I’ll kick myself if I turn it down for a job I’m a lot less excited about just because I didn’t want to travel as far.

As seen in the title my job search has been off the chain as of recent. I currently work a 645 to 415 job where I make 35k and work 50+ hours a week. It is soul-draining and I can not do this much longer.

I am currently paying my minimum on my loans among numerous other expenses, I am in no position to just quit until I am able to find a new career.

I graduated a year ago ( Dec '19) from an above-average business program, with a degree in logistics and supply chain. I was quite active, through my fraternity and the supply chain club. My grades were good (3.4) and I am was also able to graduate a year early due to workload and credits from HS.

I look great on paper, I am even better IRL. Not too gloat but I am currently among the top 5 trainees in my current company ( 500+) in sales, but I just have no interest in working there and would leave at the drop of a hat.

However, my job search is horrid, like worse than Season 8 of GOT. I have only been applying to supply chain/logistics field positions. For the most part its been assistants or entry-level positions, and a few higher-level positions for giggles. But its been three weeks now and I have not gotten a single reply, not even a rejection letter.

I have already submitted my resume to r/Resume for help and even used a website to generate a resume.

What I am asking is should I continue busting my chops at my current company or should I leave and work a part-time position and focus solely on finding a better career?

Also if anyone has been in this position, I could really use some advice as I am freshly turned 22 years old just trying to enjoy my early twenties while also being able to pay off some of this ever-increasing debt...

Psycho bitch: mid-late 30s

Recently my boyfriend/FI popped the question after a year together! We work at the same company but he’s in a different office an hour away. 

About a week after that I got a work email at 3AM from some bitch (PB) in his office. Claimed they’d been dating for 5 years, he’s the father of her 9 y/o daughter, how could I sleep at night destroying a family, I don’t need a husband when I have a good job, and if I could get a white man why did I need to “take a good Black man.” She threatened to go to my supervisor that I was “fraternizing at work”. 

I emailed her back, “Don’t ever contact me again; and do your career a favor and keep made-up personal drama off your work server.” 

Both FI & several friends at his office confirmed FI’s story - he took her out once 5 years ago for workday lunch while PB was going through a divorce.  (I knew this before we got together) Also a friend sent me some screenshots of FB - PB and her daughter are the whitest people ever. Turns out the little girl’s dad knows my parents and is a good guy.  

In other words PB built a lot up in her mind & people have been working to make her understand it’s not true; they were never in a relationship. 

I went to PB’s supervisor; she got written up & had to attend sensitivity training or something. 

My supervisor wasn’t delighted that I was dating someone at the company, especially since FI and I (and 150-some others) roll up to the same VP. He said that going to the supervisor was unnecessary and that I needed to “hide (my) disdain for single moms better.”  He was unable to provide specifics. 

I just learned that the other night PB went on some bender and sent out a bunch of unhinged messages to coworkers about me ruining her and her daughters life before attempting suicide (in front of the girl). I’m horrified she got to that point, but also furious she brought my name into it.

331,My problem is I keep taking jobs that don’t take me any where. How do I pick a career where I can really grow & not be stagnant from false promises?,217,giz7wx,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/giz7wx/my_problem_is_i_keep_taking_jobs_that_dont_take/,36,"Where to start...I have a degree in graphic design and have been doing this for about 9ish years. I’m currently getting my degree in Marketing and slowly have been getting into that industry for the past 4 years. My track record has shown that I keep accepting job offers that promise opportunities that never seem to come to fruition. 

When I first decided to switch to marketing (bc I couldn’t find any decent paying jobs in graphic design in my area) I took a job in marketing at a small (but had a huge client list across the country) business that promise I would be working & gaining experience in marketing. They wanted someone fresh because they never really had a designated marketing person and it would be a great growing experience for both of us. They were the ones who got me back in school for marketing. I stayed there a little over 3 years and ended up only really ever doing graphic design with minimal raises, barely any marketing experience, and no promotions. I eventually left that company when they opened a new position in marketing & never considered me for the position (even though this would have been GREAT marketing experience for me and i expressed interest in the position) to give it to someone outside the company that eventually came out she had no idea what she was doing. 

I had another dumb job that didn’t even last a year and now I’m at my current job. Once again, during the hiring process promised me that they wanted someone with my background because they wanted to start actively branding the company and wanted to really start marketing their charitable events. Well, surprise surprise, 2 years later I only KIND OF started to dip my toe into marketing. But the small amount of projects I’ve tried to get started have just been shut down or nothing ever comes of it. So long story short I did work for absolutely no reason. I’m ready to leave this job now too but I need some guidance on how to pick better job opportunities that won’t leave me stagnant or just doing graphic design for low pay.

My role for the first year has consisted of Project Manager, Designer, and Foreman actually working in the field on a couple of projects due to staff constraints. Before I joined, the company’s revenue was around 500-600k. This year, the company revenue will total 800-850k. We couldn’t produce any more work than that because there aren’t enough skilled employees, and frankly the existing employees are pretty awful (lazy, bare minimum, can’t wait to be laid off, etc.).

The company owner tried for over a year to hire a designer/manager to take over for him as he wants to move toward retirement, and I don’t think he expected me to basically take over the entirety of design/sales and crew management in the first year. My potential is limited by the size of the company and lack of skilled and motivated staff. I am confident that I could sell over 2 million in projects per year for a company that can handle that volume of work. 

I was hired in at 65k per year based on the first year sales of 200k (owner saw the first year as a transition phase for him getting out of design/sales so he took a small pay cut). I’ve sold 1.1 million, but the company literally can’t produce that amount of work in a single year, so how do I go about a hefty salary negotiation since I’m basically driving the whole damn ship for the owner? There are other companies 1-2 hours away from my current city hiring design/sales positions with salaries and great benefit packages well over 100-120k, which I feel I could absolutely achieve. 

I’m not sure what the best move is for me career wise. I don’t want to insult my current boss and ask for a massive pay increase, but I do need to explore and consider what’s best for myself and my family.

So our company is quite small - growing moderately - and without sounding big headed, I have helped the company grow a lot. I know they really need me and my skills as a designer, however my manager takes most of the credit of my work, therefore he is getting promoted more than me (I also get the fact he is the manager) and instead I have received a small salary increase instead.

Anyways, the manager treats me like crap most of the time, our boss can also be horrible and demands the best quality of work with the shortest amount of time possible (so working OT/working over weekends) and if you don't deliver, you're just not good enough for their company. My manager has honestly been horrible to me, even the staff in different departments commented on how he speaks to me.

My notice period is a month, and I know for a fact he's going to be so horrible when I tell him I will be moving to a different company (sort of a competitor too), and I'm just not willing to sit through for a month of hell. He's currently been nice because one of our ex assistant had left a horrible glassdoor review of working for the company.

What should I do? Should I lie that I'm leaving the city to go back home? I know he will be constantly asking and prying for the rest of my notice period so I can't exactly say 'I can't tell you/I don't need to tell you'.

Karma was too low to post on other subs so I'm trying this one. Also, title edited to be a question.

**Update:** She appears to be not pregnant. I've started FreeCodeCamp's curriculum and enrolled into college with a Associates in Computer Science (2 year degree). I plan to complete Codecademy's curriculum and some stuff on Coursera. 

Current  situation: I work a minimum wage part-time job, just enrolled back into  college a week ago. My only education is a GED (though I have a hobby  for computers, programming and webdev) and I have a basic driver's  license. I'm 32 with nothing really saved. I don't have my own place, I  rent a spare room from a buddy. So that's not good.

I  don't have a criminal background and I'm not into drugs. I have a  nicotine problem I'm quitting so those are pluses. I'd like to think I'm  not totally stupid, just very unmotivated (GED test scores were great,  but I never did anything beyond that).

I've been messing with development on and off for a while. I really enjoy webdev and Python 3, an avid fan of Linux and the Rust language has piqued my interest. C seems nice, too. I'd like a career making around 40k or so starting. Nothing crazy but something more sustainable for me and a possible family.

Anyway,  we did the dirty and I'm pretty sure it was close enough to ovulation  that she will get pregnant. For safety's sake, I'm assuming she is. So I  guess I'm asking dads her for advice. My roommate has a daughter and he said he cleaned up his act pretty damn quick once he found out, which I  think I'll do, but I'd like some input on how to proceed. I grew up  extremely poor and I definitely do not want to put a child through that.  The girlfriend has a job and a lot of career/school options ahead  (she's a CNA and wants to move up in the chain). We both agreed school  is top priority for better careers. I know this is probably a waste for  certain things, but I feel that medicine and technology are two fields  that college can be beneficial for.

Hey all,

Long-time lurker, first time poster so appreciate all of the good content.

My entire life and career I have heard that networking is everything, your ""net worth"" so to speak. While I agree wholeheartedly and think that I have done a good job thus far in my career in building a network, I also can admit that this is an area that I seek to improve upon, especially in the Covid age where a lot more networking will be done virtually.

My questions for this sub are:

* What are some of your do's and don'ts for effective networking?
* How do you go about managing and maintaining your network after an initial relationship has been built?
* Are there any resources (e.g. videos, podcasts, books, etc.) that you would recommend to become organically better at networking?

A little bit of background on me, I am a first year full-time MBA who spent 5 years working in management consulting, typically within banking and financial services, but am looking to pivot careers hence my newfound interest in improving my networking skills.

Would appreciate any insights, perspectives, or thoughts you all may have. Thanks very much.",1599094843.0,2020-09-02 21:00:43

I would just quit my first offer, but I am worried the background check won't go through. I am mostly concerned because my last job was an unpaid volunteer internship. HR at my previous internship won't be able to verify my ""employment"". Only me previous manager. Do you think this will make me fail the background check?

I was too agreeable at my last job, and thought taking on more work would be the way to career success. While most coworkers and supervisors liked me, they just gave me extra work without meaningful compensation, and I became ""the workhorse""? 

When I started my new job, I was excited to make a better impression. I wanted to be liked, but taken seriously, and setup a good foundation for promotions and raises. 

The learning curve was pretty high for me. It seemed that I walked into a role that was pretty unforgiving to new hires, with many different time-sensitive procedures (all of them were extremely similar to eachother and easy to confuse), and most of the coworkers have been doing the job for years so it seems easy to them. I've also made a lot of silly mistakes from being nervous or overwhelmed, and a few large ones that got me in trouble, and it definitely didn't help my case with others.

I found myself slipping back into being overly apologetic, and too nice. People seem to treat me like im friendly, but stupid. They dont have a lot of patience with me even though its only been a little over a month. My skills are improving, but not as fast as I'd like, and I'm not allowed to bring materials home for extra training.  

I know I'll eventually get better, and I should stop being so overly apologetic/thankful. How **should** you act around your boss and coworkers to set yourself up for promotions and raises, without just ending up taken advantage of?",1599366275.0,2020-09-06 00:24:35

There was an instant attraction there, something that I can’t imagine myself feeling for anything else. 

But, well, I have to. First, my mental health started to suffer and even though I had completed my pilot training, I was no longer eligible for a medical. I took the opportunity to refocus, and try my hand at being an aircraft mechanic. Employers didn’t appreciate how many doctor’s appointments I had to go to (comparatively speaking, not fucking many actually lmao, there’s a toxic culture there but we won’t get into that)

So I got a job working the parts counter at a local farm supply store and started my application to join the Canadian Forces as a reservist to wrench on planes there. 

And then I got diagnosed with ideopathic intracranial hypertension. That was fairly traumatic. And also life changing. 

My hopes of ever again flying an airplane have gone out the window. If people didn’t like the amount of appointments I had before, they definitely wouldn’t want me on now that I have a rare disease that will require ongoing care. Say goodbye to any chance of joining the military lmao.

Cuz I’m not supposed to over-exert myself or do any heavy lifting and that shit used to be my jam. 

So how in the heck can I find something new I can be passionate about? Because I don’t just want a job. I have that. But I need a fulfilling career. I am just having a hard time thinking of anything with the limitations I now have.

At first, I really liked this job because my team in digital marketing was really great and fun and I got to learn a lot. But one problem is that our management (CEO, VPS etc) are super disorganized. Like has no clear vision of what they want, gives super vague instructions and indecisive on the output, gives us tasks without any working materials or assets and gets mad when the results aren't skyrocketing. The DM team itself is also fairly new (around a year).

Before, I could bear it cus I liked our team lead and the process but since the pandemic hit, they've pretty much wave after wave of lay offs because we weren't showing results/cost cutting (we work with international students so that's important to know). I was spared because: 1. I was the only writer they had at the time for both operations and marketing, 2. the only one who didnt quit, 3. the only one who could work in a fast-paced environment.

Right now though, I'm starting to really hate it here. Management is still super disorganized and has no direction, the new marketing head doesnt communicate anything and just tells me to do this and that so I have no idea what the direction of our marketing is supposed to go, work hours are spilling over to my free time, and the new 'senior writer and communications specialist' they hired is super rude and mean. Like he just barks orders and tells me to do the stuff he was assigned to do (like simply telling the devs or designers to make this web page etc).

I was gonna suck it up until the end of the virus at least but something our new video editor said struck me. He said he wondered why they needed a new guy who doesnt know the brand of the company or know where to get the materials be the lead coordinator/project manager when the end result is that people turn to me to ask for those stuff anyway. And why they couldnt have just promoted me to senior and hired someone in my place. And like I dont wanna brag but I've been doing really good and have become familiar with all these things so I was thinking maybe he has a point.

So on top of feeling overworked, underpaid, and dissatisfied, I have to add underappreciated too haha.

I'm a 22 year old male from the USA about to graduate with a degree in Software Engineering (Computer Science) in 2021. I had an internship and honestly it was the perfect job for someone going into my field, it was fun, exciting, and hands on.

I just don't feel any type of reward from working hourly paid jobs, maybe because I don't feel the direct impact of what I am doing, plus I hate belonging to a big group.

I noticed I am much more productive when I'm not following other peoples orders. For example, over the breaks I would sometimes do unassigned projects on my own, then when the next semester would start a professor would assign something similar and I would end up procrastinating and barely submit it on time while I had already completed something similar. I also work as a freelance mobile mechanic and do heavy research on the vehicles that I fix and I have a lot of enjoyment working on their cars.

In my life I had worked 12 different jobs (construction, software internships, mechanic engineering internships, Retail, etc.) and I would always think cynical thoughts to cripple the companies.

I'm currently deciding whether to just graduate and finish my degree in Software Engineering, then apply for dental school and eventually open my own practice.

My dream in life is to work less than half the year in the States, and spend the rest of the year in a Latin American country with the money I saved up working in the USA. Basically make 40k in 6 months then live in Central America for the other 6 and repeat this process.

After five years working 70 hour weeks and being consumed by stress, I have finally burned out and left the finance industry. I’m done. It’s not worth it.

I’m in the process of making a career shift, which will take a while and is a pretty anxiety-inducing process by itself to begin with. I start an online bootcamp on an ancillary field that seems more in line with what I want out of a career, but this bootcamp is expected to take nine months. And it starts in December. That’s a very long time without generating any cash flow.

So I’m trying to find a “regular” hourly or temp job. Just something I can work at so I can pay my bills without dipping into my savings TOO much. It also helps break up the monotony; I have a lot of energy and I know myself well enough to know that if I spent the next nine months alone in my apartment studying for an online bootcamp all day with not much else, I will lose it.

I’ve been seriously struggling trying to find any leads, probably because I've never had a job outside my (linear and specialized) field so I'm very lost and confused as to how any of this works. I feel like the notion of a supervisor who worked at big finance firms for Fortune 100 clients trying to get a temp job for $17/hr is inconceivable to them and I'll just get laughed out of the room by recruiters or hiring managers. I would have the same apprehension if I was on their end, probably think the resume got sent by mistake or something. But the issue is... I don't know what type of jobs these agencies are hiring for. So I don't know how to tailor my resume. Basically my brain is a massive fucking pretzel right now.

I just want a place where I can go, put my head down and do some entry-level job for a few months as supplemental income that will help keep me from getting stir crazy. Pay doesn’t really matter to me; anything above $15/hr or so is fair game. I feel like I'm overthinking this, but I'm just totally lost. 2020 mirite?

My husband stuggled through college, but he made it, graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. The problem was his final GPA was a 2.5 (lots of events happened that lead to the final number. No excuses being made here though).

No entry level mechanical engineering jobs would even interview him, siting his GPA was too low. Fast forward a few years and he’s had a job as a auto cad drafter & auto cad tech. We thought, ok he has some job experience, let’s try applying to low level jobs at the engineering firms. Maybe now the GPA won’t be an issue.

He applied to a hiring event at an engineering firm. His sister knew the guy running the event, he spoke with him before the event and heard they were desperate to get people in. He wasn’t even allowed into the hiring event because his GPA is a mandatory field and they automatically kick out anything lower than a 3.0.

Does this mean his GPA will always keep him from becoming a mechanical engineer? How do you get a foot in the door to even be interviewed if places don’t even look at your experience because of GPA? Should he be thinking of a new career path?

I’m wondering if she’s really trying to be helpful or if she’s campaigning for a supervisor position. We are on the same team & have the same job title. Also worth noting, I have been doing this job for 3 years, she has been with the company for a couple years but is new to this role. She is also at least 30 years older than me.

Today she sent an email to myself, my manager, and a couple of other coworkers that I work closely with. It included a list of “best practices” when onboarding our clients and said she was excited to teach me how to do so. Again, this is a job I’ve been doing for 3 years and have never received a complaint about my quality of work. The kicker about this email is that she also felt the need to copy and paste our job description into it.  I spoke with a coworker that was also on the email to see if I had missed something and to find out why this email was even sent, and that coworker confirmed that I have not had any missteps in these areas so the email seems very out of the blue. 

There have also been a couple of instances where she checks in to make sure I’ve done things on my accounts that she is not involved in. Every time she asks these questions the answer is yes, I have done it, but she continues to go out of her way to make sure I’m doing my job.  It’s out of character for members of our team to check that other teammates are completing work properly, (whether that’s right or wrong for our organization I’m unsure) I can’t imagine ever doing this to another member of my team. It feels like she’s stepping on my toes but I don’t want to seem ungrateful if she truly is trying to help.

So, when people talk about things like “show company loyalty” or “align with your peers” or “trust your boss”, I just can’t take any of it seriously anymore. You can follow “the rules” in the workplace and still get screwed over. You can build rapport and still get sabotaged. You can do everything right on paper, and still get treated as nothing more than replaceable cog.

Where can I go from here?,191,ihyi86,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ihyi86/almost_30_and_feel_like_im_starting_over_where/,75,"Hey reddit, a little background on myself: I graduated with a BA in Music in 2014 concentrating on guitar. I love music and continue to write, perform, and teach private lessons to this day. I supplemented this with a part time job as a writing tutor at a community college, which I enjoyed.

To spare some irrelevant details, Covid hit and I was forced to make a change. I applied to a new charter school in my area to teach elementary music, but I am quickly realizing classroom teaching is not for me (and covid restrictions certainly don't help). Plus, I would eventually have to go back to school to earn my teaching license if I wanted to to keep teaching, which I am uninterested in.

My plan as of now is simply to survive the school year or this semester at least, but I honestly don't know where to turn from here. I love playing music, but I've never been at a point to where I've been able to make a comfortable living and if I don't stay in education I'm at a loss. I've considered a few scenarios:

1. Go back to school to earn an associate's degree in a specified skill/trade. I'm particularly interested in electronics/mechatronics. I enjoy working with my hands and it seems to be a growing field with good prospects.

2. Utilize my experience in the community college system to find something full time in administration/student development. While I think I'd be a good fit for these type of positions, I've applied to many related jobs but haven't had much luck. Most people have Master's degrees, and again, I'm very hesitant of the cost in that level of education.

3. The most unconventional, but go back to school/get training on piano tuning/repair or other music instrument repair. As I said, I enjoy working with my hands and this will keep me most connected to my passions. The downside is I would have to more or less pave my own way as there wouldn't necessarily be a ready made job on the other side. 

In each of these scenarios, I will continue to play music and strive to meet my musical goals, but no longer rely on them necessarily to make my living. At the end of the day, I just want to earn a comfortable living with a job that's not too stressful and allows a decent work/life balance. I'd appreciate any insight!

I was at my last job (software engineer) for almost three years.  I was never really great at my job and definitely hit a plateau at some point where I wasn't really improving.  I was slow, not an enthusiastic ""team player"", etc.  Basically, I was a crappy employee, but I did churn out decent work (even if I was slow).  It was pretty much my fault because I was burnt out, had over-committed my time outside of work, and had some personal issues.

Anyways, I was eventually fired, and the reason given was performance issues.  As much as it pains me to admit, I deserved this outcome and I did have performance issues.  I have taken a long time since then to deal with a lot of my issues and I have made a lot of progress!! I no longer feel burnt out, I am doing some online courses to refresh my skills and build some new ones, I have dealt with a lot of personal issues that were really bogging me down in the past.

That's all great, but the question is how do I navigate discussing i) my firing and ii) the very large gap in my employment in an interview.  Even though I feel that I have made positive change in my life, I think that this probably looks horrible from an employer's perspective.  The fact that I deserved to be fired sort of complicates things as well.

What are my options?",183,f0pysh,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f0pysh/after_more_than_a_decade_of_trying_ive_come_to/,72," I'm turning 30 in a few months and don't really have anything to show for it. Since I was about five years old I've been 'the computer guy' to my family and friends, and while I've had other interests along the way, most have been for fun and not necessarily something I could make a profit off of, or make into a lifestyle. I've been swapping parts and making upgrades since before I was allowed to use the stove. In the past I've been steered back into tech whenever I decide on a whim to do something differently, because according to my friends, my folks, my family, etc, ""you have an innate knowledge for how machines work, and you're very socially awkward, so tech is perfect for you"".

I went to college for Computer Science, and my professors told me I wasn't cut out for it. I figured, that's nonsense, I'm the computer guy, if I work hard enough and believe I can do it I can be a success story just like every other success story I've read about. Turns out the real world doesn't work that way, and I was transferred to the 'web and game design' major. They didn't want me in that department either but I managed to stick it out. I took a ton of unrelated electives to bring up my GPA enough to stay in school (I don't regret that because I got to take some very cool classes), and I eventually graduated with a very poor major GPA (and a great non-major GPA) and have worked a bunch of Geek Squad/Apple Store/helpdesk related jobs, and a smattering of retail/food service jobs as well.

I've done countless hours of research on how to become a software engineer or IT professional. If I had to guess I'd say somewhere around 12000-18000 hours. Researching bootcamps, languages, putting together websites, doing FreeCodeCamp, going to tech nights and hackathons, it's been a ride for sure. I signed up for HackReactor, Thinkful, AppAcademy, Operation Spark, they all told me I don't have the knack but I kept trying, figuring eventually it'd all click and at that point the pieces would just fall into place. A little while ago I decided I'd make one final effort to make this happen, I enrolled in college for my second Bachelors at a 'go at your own pace' college, this time in Computer Science, and somehow this time I've been able to stick with the program, though I'm much slower than my peers and on average it takes me twice as long to finish courses.

Well, six months into the program and I'm slowly beginning to realize that the reason I've never really been able to 'get it' is that I genuinely hate working with computers, and that scares the hell out of me. In the past few weeks I've found myself doing all the household chores I normally can't stand to procrastinate having to write code/study. I sit down, scroll up and down my 'notes' page a couple times, and say ""you know, I don't think the shower has been re-grouted in a while, better get on that"". My entire identity, for the past 24+ years, has been based on the idea that at some point I'll be some big shot tech guy. I literally have no other skills.

I feel like I've put all of my eggs (and at this point, enough money to buy a small home) into being 'the computer guy' and if I'm not that, I'm literally starting over from scratch. Technically starting from pre-scratch, because I honestly have no idea what else is out there. People online always say ""start with what you like"" but in my case I have no idea what I like because I've never tried anything else. I know I can't join the military, or go into the trades, because I'm moderately disabled (both mentally and physically).

I've written a novel here and it's certainly been cathartic but I also feel I'm on the verge of a breakdown. I honestly have no idea what I'm supposed to do at this point.",1581186886.0,2020-02-08 13:34:46

A little about what me and what I'm ultimately looking for:

I have 5 years of experience in management and logistic roles, one for a car manufacturer, the other for a major cell phone provider. I was part of a major lay off in January 2019, rode out my severance for a long time, but now the funds are running dry, and I am still getting nowhere with job applications. I've had my resume critiqued online and in person, and everyone says it is great, so I'm not totally sure why I am not getting any calls for interviews.

Since my main experience is in management, both retail and logistics, I've applied to a number of positions within Amazon, FedEx, UPS, corporate retail store locations, but I feel like my resume and application is mostly just going into the ""void"" as I call it, where it seems like maybe there is a fair bit of luck in getting seen. The other problem is, I haven't really had to job search for a long time in my life, since I graduated college essentially, so I'm about 8 years out of it. I've updated my resume, signed up for Indeed/LinkedIn/etc, but still feeling stuck. 

The past year I've had my hopes and dreams set on opening a business (bar/tavern/brewery), but I'm realizing I just don't have enough money unfortunately, even after working with the SBA and other organizations.

So where I'm at now is a dwindling bank account, and possibly needing to liquidate my 401k ~$26,000 to keep going until I find the right work that covers my expenses, and ultimately is something that is rewarding for me, aka I don't want to just work another dead end job through my 30s.

What I'm wondering now is, should I find a headhunter that maybe has connections in companies so I get noticed more? I'm in a city with lots of young professionals, so I'm feeling maybe my resume is lost in the void as I said earlier. Or do I need to find a new approach to applying for jobs in the even more internet age? Do I need a career shift? I've always thought CS/coding jobs sound great, especially with the high pay. I've looked into coding bootcamps, but for every positive I've seen about them, I've read equally negative things or how they aren't needed.

I am a 25-year-old college grad, trying to pursue a career in marketing/ media. However, due to a series of setbacks (some of them my fault, others not so much), my resume is terrible. It's basically a collection of short-term jobs, all of which have had really terrible endings...which is also an issue because it makes me uncomfortable using references. My work history is riddled with gaps, as well.

I feel like I'm in a hole, and don't know how to get my career back on track. I have so many resume gaps, and haven't even had one job for an entire year yet. I really want to start working on my professional goals, but feel as though a couple wrong moves that I made immediately after graduating have set the tone for my career moving forward- and it's very far from the one I wanted.

***Please note:*** *While grad school would be a good solution, I cannot afford it and even if I could, I've missed the deadlines for several schools with ""mandatory summer starts""; meaning I'd have to wait until summer 2021 to start, which isn't an option.*

Here is a **timeline of my professional life since graduation**.

**Background:** 

\-Graduated in 2017 with a major in Media Studies (focused in Advertising) and minors in both Marketing and Creative Writing. 

\-Had a few great internship opportunities, while still in school- one with a major media company (wound up not working out because I lived in Virginia and couldn't get to Los Angeles in the time span they gave me), and the other was a remote internship with a large online magazine, which I completed.

\-Graduated with honors, 3.3 Cumulative GPA and 3.6 Major GPA.

\-Was in long-term relationship (nearly 5 years) with guy whose graduation was pushed back a year, due to changing majors- meaning, he was staying in the college town and I would be too, seeing as we'd been living together for years.

**Timeline:**

***May 2017-*** Graduated

***Summer 2017-*** Worked at marketing internship w/ large restaurant chain in college town, in order to stay with boyfriend. 

***Fall 2017-*** Took a call center job, in order to make money while job hunting. Still doing this to stay with boyfriend. *Stupid decision.*

***December 2017-*** Could not find job. Got cheated on. Wound up quitting call center job, breaking up with boyfriend, and moving back in with parents.

***Winter 2018-*** Applied for full-time jobs, while working as a ""temp"" secretary (with some unofficial marketing work) at a real estate company, through a staffing agency.

***Spring 2018-*** Could not find a full-time marketing job, with so little experience. Was offered a full-time job with Real Estate company, a.k.a. ""buyout"" from staffing agency, so I would be an official employee, not a temp. Promised marketing/social media responsibilities. Decided to pursue this. Even submitted application and deposit for company-owned apartment next to office.

***May 2018-*** One manager turned out to be mentally unhinged. Stole my $250 deposit for the apartment, stole my SSN, and more. Upper management knew she had done this for days before reporting it to me. (Long story). I quit the job.

***June 2018-*** Got together with new boyfriend. Applied for marketing jobs, but was unsuccessful. Temp agency stopped working with me because I had called the authorities on my former employer for stealing from me. Basically said that their business w/ the company was more important than me.

***July 2018-*** Boyfriend got job with large tech company in Silicon Valley. I had always wanted to go to California and so had he, so we decided to take a leap of faith and go, despite me not having a job lined up. Stupid decision.

***August 2018-*** Moved to Cali. Had been applying and still was. No responses.

***Fall 2018-*** Job hunt unsuccessful. Even fast food places weren't hiring. Too many people, not enough jobs. Did not have a car, which lowered the radius I could travel and hurt my chances further. Went into crushing debt.

***Winter 2018-*** Went home alone for a month or so, to get my finances back under control. Applied for jobs.

***January 2019-*** Received job offer from startup in Silicon Valley. Accepted offer and returned to boyfriend in California.

***Winter/Spring 2019-*** Worked my a\*\* off for company, barely making anything ($20/hr in San Fran- no time and a half for overtime, which happened a lot). Started to notice some shifty things about them- paying me through Venmo-like app, no incoming revenue, etc. 

***May 2019-*** Found out from people ""working for us"" that they were being tricked into free labor. Tried to talk to employer to fix this and make company legitimate, but was shut down. Started applying for other jobs.

***Early July 2019-*** Startup tanking. People quitting left and right. Mental health rapidly declining. Received offer for a job a few states away, so I quit and moved with my boyfriend.

***Late July 2019-*** Got to new city after a long road trip. Called new employer to verify address and start time for first day that Monday. Found out that they had decided to hire an internal candidate at the last minute, and I was never informed. At this point, I'm in a new city and I'm homeless and unemployed.

***August 2019-*** Started working with local temp agency. Got good Marketing gig. Pay was low, but it was work. The contract was for one month, but they were planning on hiring me full-time after it ran out. Even had me write out a list of things I needed for the Marketing department for upcoming year, in order to get them approved during budget meetings. They were approved.

***September 2019-*** Received a phone call on one month anniversary of starting job. It was the temp agency. They said the company couldn't afford to hire me, so they were taking me off the position immediately and would find something else for me. I was devastated, but had no say. Contract said company couldn't work directly with me for a year after contract ended.

***Fall 2019-*** Temp agency could not find anything and basically ghosted. Unemployed, except for an odd job here or there. Broke. Crippling debt getting worse. Applying for jobs every day. Unsuccessful. Every marketing company that contacted me back was one of those MLM scam agencies, posing as legit businesses. 

***November 2019-*** Went home again for financial and health reasons. Kept applying for jobs.

***December 2019-*** Had a few interviews, but got turned down for a few things due to being home for the holidays. Finally got an offer for a phone sales role. I had little interest, but needed the income.

***March 2020-*** Have been working at new job since early January 2020. Pay is low. Hours are long. Metrics are unreasonable, and valued over actual productivity. Forced overtime with no pay. Employer won't even let us work from home during Coronavirus outbreak- despite having the tech to do so and confirmed/suspected cases among employees. I need to find a new job to transition into, once quarantine is over. 

&#x200B;

**So, here I am.** In the past, I've been told by hiring managers that my short-term assignments, lack of updated references, and resume gaps are red flags. I get that 100%. However, ever since graduating, I've been applying to crazy amounts of jobs each year and have been getting turned down due to lack of experience for 95% of those. Meanwhile, the jobs that have interviewed/ hired me have unfortunately been so easy to get a job with, or so it would appear, because they're not good companies to work for.

I am so set back in my life right now, all while desperately trying to get out of debt, get legal help for the cases that require it, and get my career started. I'm so depressed having to pay my student loans each month, despite not having worked one day in a full-time, salaried marketing role since finishing school.

&#x200B;

**What can I do (other than go to grad school), to get my career back on track?**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Since graduation, I haven't been able to secure a good job due to lack of experience. The companies that have hired me have been terrible to work for, resulting in short employment periods, a lack of recent references, and lots of resume gaps. This is affecting my ability to get a good job in my field and I don't know how to turn things around. Please help.",1584434201.0,2020-03-17 04:36:41

It was taking a toll on me but I decided to try my best because it was an extremely well known company. On top of it, coworkers abused me on the internal chat and my manager didn’t pay any heed to it. However, the work culture is pretty well known to be harsh and cutthroat. I didn’t realise it was that bad before I joined.

During the mid term review of my probation they just said that I’m not a good fit for this position and handed me a letter of termination. I sunk and felt even more miserable than I was when I had the job. Now I’m in a confusing state of mind of being unemployed but also can’t help myself of thinking I could’ve tried harder or maybe tried to do things differently. 

I don’t know what to do or where to go from here. Can anyone help me with some reassurance that what happened, happened for the best? Or is this on me?

427,I've permanently ruined my life. What jobs can actually pay for cheap rent?,184,c70fro,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c70fro/ive_permanently_ruined_my_life_what_jobs_can/,160,"I need more than 15 dollars an hour to pay rent off a 70 hour work week. Grubhub just cut our pay by 25%... again, bringing their pay in line with others like Uber. so im making 10 an hour. Honestly, 100 hours a week is unsustainable. 

Ok, information you need: I have a low IQ, the time i got a driving job at Jimmy johns it took me weeks to learn the menu which is supposed to be memorized before the first day; 

I worked two days outdoor manual labor but had severe cramps from dehydration and almost legit died. I actually enjoyed carrying around 100+ lb boxes in a warehouse freezer but that was 7.50 an hour. Not afraid of manual labor, just can't be outside in the heat;

 I have aspergers, so i REALLY suck at sales, passing interviews, customer service and such like; 

I have 130 college hours, but this does not include any third and fourth year courses because i failed them all. On paper im two years away from graduating, the reality is it's not going to happen;

 I have a cdl, this may be misleading to you. So i drove a truck for a year on a team, which is two drivers per truck, truck runs 24/7. On a team they pay both drivers the rate of the most experienced. So at the top of their pay scale i made 32 thousand that year typically working 6 hours more per week than is legal. Home daily trucking jobs are 12 to 14 per hour 2 years experience, no exceptions. The 32k job was listed as up to 75k on indeed just for context. Yes i can get paid 100k as a trucker if i buy a truck from them, but after payments and maintenance it works out to 50k per year for ten years! The super awesome part of this deal is that you can't drive a 3 year old truck for most trucking companies, so you have to give the truck back and lose all the payments you made. ""Welcome to American! Right this way, please spread your ass cheeks for your convenience sir!"" And im constantly seeing titles like ""Trucking companies can't understand why MilLeNialS refuse to work for them"". Well... it's because the pay is worse than cleaning toilets for McDonald's; 



and finally because ive been working as an independent contractor for the last three years most companies consider me to have been jobless for three years, even though ive been working 70 hours a week.



 STOP READING HERE! IM JUST ADDING CONTEXT. 



So my McDonalds interview is typical of how an interview works. They only hire ""Positive"" individuals, i don't understand what that means, but i came in with a big smile on my face and was yes sir yes maam the entire time. And of course i didn't get the job even with my one year Jimmy johns experience. Aspergers is like having a tattoo on your face, it doesn't matter how hard you try everyone knows their not supposed to hire you. 

The worst part about all of this is my parents disappointment. They cut all the job adds out if the news paper and ask me why im not applying anywhere. I used to say that i couldn't get an interview, but then my parents tell me to just go there in person. Every time ive gone somewhere in person ive been told they only do online applications. Now days i don't tell my parents how my job hunt is going. Real talk, ive counted the businesses in my (one of the top ten largest citys in the US) for different industries, and im legit running out of places to be rejected by. If i could get a job with even a glimmer of hope that i would be able to live a decent life. I would work 120 hours a week at literal running speed. I can make an assembly robot look lazy.  

 Hard work means nothing in America, this is purely an IQ economy and social IQ is the only IQ that matters. TLDR: Nobody is hiring aspergers, nobody, no exceptions, period.

I've had a number of jobs paying minimum wage or barely higher since then, most of them customer service, and a couple manual labor. I currently work with a retail inventory service as an inventory counter; I scan and count, there's nothing demanding or rewarding about it.

I want to do something with my life, I have a very low standard of living at the moment, and I'm really sick of living like this.

My issue is that I just have no idea what I should be doing to improve my life.

I got my PhD in a technical field. Afterward, I was briefly in academia. By the time I moved into industry 3 years ago, I already hated everything about the field I work in. After my time in companies, the idea of having to do anything for anyone (in a transactional, work-related way) makes me physically ill.

It's been over a year since I last applied for a job. If I see a job I'm qualified for, I give up at the thought of having to lie to someone's face and pretend any kind of enthusiasm for technical work. When someone asks me about ""data"", or ""machine learning"", it's the best I can do to hold back my bile.

If I see a job in a different career (and hence something I might potentially hate less), I'm turned off simply by the idea of having to self-promote.

I'm trapped by my semi-irrational avoidance of work-related bullshit, even as I miss being engaged in projects and... having good week days. I know to get out of this situation (whether that means career change or whatever), I am going to have to get through distasteful and uncomfortable situations, but I don't know if I \*can\* anymore.

I miss feeling excited and motivated by a new challenge, but I don't know how to recover that mindset. Anything positive about work  - whether money or the work itself - is completely overshadowed by the nightmare of politics and hierarchy. I also despise anything related to writing/creating software (which seems to be all anyone wants me to do).

I'm currently employed, but I dread every day of work and do the absolute bare minimum possible. It's not good.

I just want to share my story here. I had a one hour interview with two managers. She said will let me know by next week. I walked out feeling not too great but then got a phone call only two hours later with an offer. Keep in mind, it’s a position that I wanted to get into since graduation so you can say is a dream position. I am nervous but excited too! It is in a field that is highly competitive and in a big city with lots of competition. 

After I calm down more, I reflect on what I have done to prepare for this. One of the managers know me just once a few months ago. She remembered my name and face and smiled when seeing me in the interview. 

Let me take you back with my strategy. I would say, if you want something badly, you need to find an alternative way to let the corresponding HR see your face or know your name at some way. 

I was so interested in this field of medicine, but the problem I had was I know nobody that works in this field at the time. My first strategy was to figure out how I can get into this community. 
Tip #1: find the job’s relevant association/club/society. For example, if you are interested in a psychology position, find the non-profit organization that support psychologists for education/network etc. I found a general request for more info box on he organization web page, and I wrote down something along the lines of: I am very interested in the field, can you connect me which someone that is in the field at XXX city area? I didn’t expect a reply honestly but I did and the secretary had found somebody in their organization that works in the field at my city that is interested in helping me. 

Tip #2: this person is a coordinator for the local part of the organization and willing to connect with me for some shadow days (after I requested it after some friendly and professional emails back-forth). I shadowed her for few days, on my last day (after strategically asking around where the managers’ office is), I went in person to talk to her (manager A) and hands a copy of my resume. I introduced myself to the manager and told her how I got in contact with the person I shadowed. She was very nice and accepted the resume but did say she has to go through the fair system of picking online process over paper. 

I didn’t hear back anything for about half a year. Honestly, mindset is so important. I didn’t focus too much on it but just have a mindset that it’s not in my control but I tried! I was able to make a connection at least! So I was happy and doing my other job in the meantime. I keep applying to the place I hand the resume to but didn’t really hear back. 

Last month, I decided it’s time to add spice to my “game”. I emailed the manager this time stating who I was and that I am still interested. I told her in the email that I have applied to the positions your department posted so please look out for that. 
I didn’t receive a reply. 

One week later, I got a phone call from the other manager B (to my very surprise since I didn’t know there were two!) and wanted to see me for an interview. 

Story goes back to now, I met the two managers. Manager A stated nice to see me again and remembered who I was. She said she forwarded my email to manager B. Manager B said that was very nice. 

At the end, the interview was challenging. But what I have learnt in this process that lasts almost half a year is so important. I also don’t think I was the most qualified candidate with the most matched experience and physical skills the job required. I believe my persistence helped them to make the decision to hire me. They know I am interested. They know I really wanted the job. They know I shadowed somebody under the team to know a little bit about the job. They know I put in real time and effort to make them know I want the job. 

I guess what I want to say is, don’t get frustrated with the process. Find a way to let them see you; find a way to let them know your name and intention. Best of luck!",1564376868.0,2019-07-29 01:07:48

444,What is the fastest way to kickstart my life as a 31 yo who wasted his life so far but wants to do whatever means necessary?,178,eexuks,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eexuks/what_is_the_fastest_way_to_kickstart_my_life_as_a/,81,"I would like to hear solid advice (by that I mean an opinion out of your expertise and experience and not just citing what google brings up on good paying entry level jobs since I already read that stuff) 

I am 31 and wasted my life due to various issues (clean record no drugs or anything but its a very long story to explain so lets leave it at that. ).

I have a non existing CV nothing solid. 

I know computer stuff (some programming, some pc architecture, some networking, some soldering and pcb diagnostics etc) but nothing on paper (either in form of certificates or provable employment ).

I have studied for a year (out of a 4 year graduate program) as a merchant marine engineer and worked for 6 months in a cargo ship as a cadet engineer. 

I have some (non provable) experience in door to door sales and phone support. 

I can speak 3 languages (English, German, Greek and a little bit French).

I am able to type ~150 words per second. 

I am a MENSA member (I know cheesy but at this point I think it might hold some significance in terms of indicating that there is a chance that I could learn something faster than average). 

I have worked as a waiter in a  fancy restaurant of a 5 star hotel.

I have some mathematics and physics skills as a drop off of an applied mathematics university.

I consider myself good in marketing and sales and have some sense of logistics in general. 

I am not afraid to work hard for long hours and do whatever (legal ).

I am from Greece and I am looking for employment anywhere within europe or north America.

My target is to work hard for 2-4 years and make some substantial savings that would allow me to stop working or work part time while pursuing my degree (and be able to pay for all the fees involved).

What do you think would be the fastest **realistic** way for me to do that?

And to prevent trolling no I am not sitting on my ass waiting for the internet to give me a solution but in the desperate position I am now a second opinion might aid to clarify my perspective.

Right now I am looking into getting a job in an offshore oil rig but I get mixed information for example I found that in many cases one can get as low as 1500 pounds a month.... which is not bad but considering you will cut off from society, eating canned food and that it is physically challenging job 1500 begins to seem small. Do you think I could do better than that ?

446,Is it okay to quit a job if its causes high anxiety? I cant deal with rejecting sick animals.,178,dgsnpp,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dgsnpp/is_it_okay_to_quit_a_job_if_its_causes_high/,69,"I had recently (1 month) started a job at an animal hospital and I thought it would be great. I love animals. I mean LOVE. I figured I could just try a part time job to see if I would maybe want to be a Vet in the future. Except from this job it was mostly just dealing with difficult clients. Like ones that belittle you and insult you. I could deal with mean clients. I've worked customer service in the food industry, but what got to me was the sick pets.

We would often get calls from owners asking if we can see their sick pets. Throwing up, seizing, itching, diarrhea, etc. It had a wide range. But the common thing was the pet was sick and the owner wanted them seen ASAP i.e. same day. Obviously I get why the owners would freak out and cause trouble but what really was causing me the emotional stress was having to refuse seeing their pets. This could happened several times a day and nearly every day I worked. We had to refuse to see the pet because there was only 1 doctor working at that hospital and we were constantly over booked and under staffed. 

When ever I had to refuse to schedule to see the sick pet that day I would try to make a future appointment for them but we were always booked out 2-3weeks out. The only other options was to direct the pet owner to another hospital or emergency hospital. This was often met with things like ""You're heartless to animals!"" or ""you guys really dont care huh?"" Like I said I've been cussed out by customers in the food industry before but it really hurts to be called heartless to animals when I really love them a lot. It just hit deep in my core. I dont know. I'm weak I guess. But this just ruined the work for me. 

I dreaded going into work each day. I fear clients calling about a sick pet. The work itself was already hard, requiring 4+ weeks of computer trainning and ~2 months of shadow trainning. I could have eventually adjusted to the hardships of the job, but the emotional anxiety just makes me want to give up. I wanted to quit week 1 but I tried to stick it out till now 1 month later. 

I know jobs can take a while to learn. I've have my hand in several other jobs in the past ranging 6 months to 2 years long. This just hurts and it's only been 1 month. 

I've written a letter of resignation and I plan to email it to my manager. I will text him to check his email. In my letter I said I want to quit immediately as I am still being shadow trained so I'm not covering any actually shifts and figured I might as well stop wasting the time of who is trainning me. I did offer to stay for 2 weeks if they wanted me to. 

I just want to know if this is the right way to do this? Is there a better way I should deliver my resignation? Can I quit without 2 weeks notice?

Should I even be quitting just because its emotionally destroying me? It has actually caused me to be getting sick recently and I cant focus in class. 

What do I do?

TLDR: Job causes me high anxiety because it deals with turning away sick pets and I love animals and just want to help them. I get yelled at by the concerned pet owners regularly. How do I quit in a professional way? Can I quit same day if they dont actually need me?

Edit: Maybe this will help some people. I am still living at home so rent isnt my concerned yet. Also some have been saying I need to suck it up bc I want to work as a Vet but I took this job to see if I was interested, not that this is my future career goal. I am actually studying Molecular Biology to work in the Biotech Industry currently. This job has solidified that I dont want to be a Vet. Also some have said this is the reality of the work force, so suck it up. Like I've said I have worked customer service before. I can deal with some crazy yelling at me about coffee being too hot or whatever. Just not this side of denying a sick pet. I'll respond to ppl directly after work....",1570899655.0,2019-10-12 13:00:55

452,Would you accept a job at another company where your ex-boss works? I liked reporting to my ex-boss.,174,jku8lj,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jku8lj/would_you_accept_a_job_at_another_company_where/,49,"I consider myself fortunate, as the bread winner in the family, to have a secure job with good benefits. But, I am over-worked and burning out with no end in sight. 

I have been reporting to my new boss for about 3 months and am not on the same page with them and have struggled to meet their expectations (many exhausting reasons that are boiled down to leadership is not providing the oversight necessary to set the team up for success). Initially, I was warned about my output and after 3 months of working late, weekends, and on days off I was told that I’m improving. 

Previously, in the same company and role, I have been a high performer with my ex-boss (I reported to them for over 3 years). They were let go due to COVID. Now I have an opportunity to work with my ex-boss at a different company. Unfortunately, it’s for less pay and less benefits. Benefits are specific to PTO accrual, holidays, and sick pay. The company my ex-boss works for will never be able to match my current company for PTO, holidays, and sick and it’s non-negotiable. The saving grace at the company my ex-boss works for is their 401(k) matching beats my current company by double after the 6 years vesting period. I tend to stay with companies where I have a good boss so I think that I will make it at least to the vesting period. 

I want to work with my ex-boss because we worked well together and grew in my career and strengths with their help. It is career adjacent - I’ve been a project manager for over a decade and this new position is as a product manager. The less pay is not insurmountable and my family would not suffer from the change too significantly. I can negotiate a review period to prove my value and potentially bump up my base salary. 

Removing all other considerations (e.g., location of work, perks, bonus, etc.) my sticking points, and what’s keeping me up at night, are: (1) should I let my better benefits go? (2) Am I putting too much trust in my ex-boss? My ex-boss has proven to me over the years we worked together that they have my best interest in mind. 

I should have an offer letter next week. 

Thank you for taking an interest.

UPDATE: Decision making is still underway and your comments have give me the different perspectives I needed. Thank you to everyone that commented. 

I’m adding that prior to applying I have spoken to my ex-boss extensively about my fit with the potential new company and culture as well as negotiated a salary (awaiting offer letter) with a possible re-negotiation after a temp period. The pay cut is not significant to impact my family and our ability to pay bills, invest in retirement, or save money. We just won’t save as much as quickly for material goods. 

Last, prior to posting I have completed a side by side financial analysis factoring benefits as a monetary metric to look at it apples to apples. The importance to me on the PTO/sick/holidays is that, for me, my work-life balance is better when I’m able to bank PTO and not be paycheck to paycheck for time off options or requesting LWOP. That’s just me and what I know about myself.

I lost my mom at the start of college. It did me no favors as she was the only positive person in my life. College didn’t work out for me and I never graduated. I feel like I’ve failed massively in this regard. I studied networking (IT)

I have a decent gig right now making 40k-ish a year. However, I wanted to be so much more. I wanted to be able to support myself and my elderly father. I feel like I’ve peaked with what I’m working with right now. I talked to school counselors and discovered I’d have to start all the way from gen ed and basically redo a whole degree. This was super disheartening. I also don’t have the luxury of  quitting my job in order to focus on school as me and my father have supported each other since my mom died.  Also, even if I went back to school, I would not continue down the networking path as it is definitely not for me.

So I feel pretty stuck. My job is not a bad job, but like I said, I feel like I’ve peaked. I want to move upwards in life, and by that I don’t mean I want fancy things and wealth. I mean that I want stability, safety, and security for me and my loved ones. I don’t want to just get by and be at risk for losing it all.

He offered effusive praise such as “everybody loves you” and told me that the job was basically in the bag. He even went as far as to tell me that they were not interviewing other candidates. I was thrilled!

The only catch? I had to complete a hiring assignment. OK, no problem.

I’ve accepted these in the past but usually they are only 1 to 2 hours at most. This one was easily 12 hours of work that I diligently completed and even went above and beyond in many respects. I had a friend of mine who is senior in the industry review my work and she agreed that it was very high-quality after I made just a couple of tweaks.

Getting to the point, the hiring manager totally blew me off and went with another candidate after I busted my ass doing this take-home assignment. I started to get suspicious of his motivations based on several red flags I regretted ignoring. Couldn’t even get any meaningful feedback from him.

Had an attorney write a letter to the company’s head general counsel reserving my copyright to the content and affirming they don’t have the right to use it. The wording was low-key, factual, and professional.

What should I do?",168,k7thov,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/k7thov/my_boss_doesnt_pay_on_time_and_i_want_to_quit_and/,59,"I'm a non-American working at a company in California. I was working there for a year on OPT, which is 1-year work authorization the US government gives international students upon graduation. After my 1 year ended, my company still wanted to keep me on, so they offered to sponsor me for a visa. This is a big deal for them. By them, I'm referring to my boss and his wife who run the company. They are both very very cheap, no-frills people who find a way to not invest money in anything. We don't have company parties, events etc. I don't have paid time off. I'm not paid for holidays. The insurance policy sucks. There's no perks, and they get angry when I work overtime. They seem to view getting paid for doing your job as a ""reward"" or ""gift."" So it was a big deal when they were willing to invest $7k in legal and processing fees to apply for my work visa, which would mean I can continue working with them for up to 6 years.

I agreed to the work sponsorship because I don't have the luxury of applying to other American jobs as a foreigner.  They too would need to sponsor me, and many don't do that with employees who had not already been working for the company. Also, the work visa is a lottery, meaning just because you apply and your company pays all the fees, it doesn't mean your application will be picked.

Anyway, despite hating the job and my boss due to their selfishness, craziness, and rudeness, I wanted to go through with the visa mainly because my boyfriend lives in California, the job offers good networking opportunities, and I didn't want to have to return to my home country.

&#x200B;

Now, I'm regretting my decision for a couple of reasons:

1. My boss's wife is the HR person and she is horrible. She doesn't reply to emails at all.
2. She consistently pays myself and other employees 2-3 days after pay date. With no real reason or explanations. I only get paid by following up with them each time.
3. Working at a place with no perks and a demanding boss makes me feel like I could be doing better. I knew this going into it, but most international students don't even get jobs after graduation, so I was just happy to get something. 
4. I make $19 an hour, which is nothing for what I do. My friends with the same major make nearly twice as much as me, thanks to being American. 
5. I would like to return to grad school.

However, I feel like I can't quit at this point, since they already spent $7k on my work visa and I have to wait for the next 3-4 months to see if that is approved, upon which I will be contracted  to work with them for at least 3 years. I'd feel guilty quitting after they spent he money on my case, but I'm really not happy here.",1607288965.0,2020-12-06 16:09:25

Today I (35f USA) find myself in quite the predicament as I am going to be a first time parent, and I am loosing my full-time job due to the pregnancy (they have notified me that they are letting me go just haven't told me when I need to stop coming to work). The best thing that I know of that I can do there is keep going until they tell me to stop so I can get unemployment as to my understanding as the business is too small for FMLA or providing any other reprieve.

Here's the tricky part: I'm the one of myself and my partner (28m) that has degrees and will have to continue to work full-time to support us and our growing family (they work full-time as well just not able to be the main source of income). I live in an area that already struggles with a high unemployment rate in the best of times, and while there are still good opportunities here, the pandemic is definitely adding to the problem.

My degrees are in the criminal justice and liberal and fine arts (law) fields with a major in psychology but no certifications or licensing. I was thinking remaining in the legal field would be best for me for now as it seems to be the safest (physically) to do while pregnant and makes a decent amount of money that we can actually live on, but I do have vast experience in a number of different fields and an open mind while searching.

I have updated my LinkedIn and indeed.com profiles, and have mostly been canvasing indeed posts thus far and not getting any responses yet after 3 weeks if applying. When I apply, I do take the time to tailor my resume and cover letter to each company. I'm trying to land something before my pregnancy becomes too obvious even though I will be honest with my new employers about it when negotiating a position. 

I am finding it very difficult to continue going to work these days as it really seems like they are trying to get me to quit so that I won't get unemployment. This is resulting in work-related depression and while I am doing my best to offset it, it is very, very difficult. I'm also concerned that the next company may let me go when I need to deliver the baby because after getting hired I will not have been there a year and will not qualify for FMLA protection.

So, all things considered, do you have any advice/resources/thoughts on what I can do to better my chances while being pregnant and job hunting during a pandemic?

The language in the email was pretty insulting tbh as I have a medical condition that involves a compromised immune system, so I get sick about once per month for a day or two, and they were calling me a 'pussy' and a 'punk' for calling in sick so frequently. Nobody knows about my condition because my boss has repeatedly said, ""if you're sick, just call in sick, I don't need a reason or an excuse."" Is this grounds to terminate me?

If I get the job after, I get a solid salary and benefits, if I don’t, it was a ROYAL waste of my life. Under any other circumstance, I wouldn’t even consider this.

I really appreciate it. <3**

My BA (East Asian Language and Lit) has gotten me nowhere other than high-end retail, and at this point I feel like I need a graduate degree in order to progress. I certainly don't mind going back to school, but I'm not sure what I even want to do.

My top two choices are a) library science or b) forensic science.

Library science makes sense as it gels with my educational background and previous internship experience as a librarian and a teacher. The work would be easy, it'd be cheaper than other degrees, and it would only last two years. It's also an easy program to get into.

The problem is that I just don't... really... want to be a librarian. I don't feel any passion for librarianship. It feels like the easiest, most mundane choice I could possibly make, and I hate that. It would be stable. It would be smart. It would be very boring.

On the other hand, there's forensic science.

Pursuing forensic science wouldn't make sense, but it's my dream career. I am deeply fascinated by everything to do with forensic science and have been since I was a child. I read forensic news and research in my spare time (which I've had a lot of lately). However, it would be a complete 180 from any of the work I've done so far. I didn't take any STEM in college, I have no background in chemistry. Is this even plausible? Is there any way I could catch up??? I'm a quick learner and I absorb information fast; is there somewhere I could start?

These things might not even matter, however, as my choices are limited by my college transcript. To be blunt: it sucks. Nearly everything from freshman to junior year is a total garbage fire with a few Bs thrown in for variety. My main problem was that I was too busy sleeping and staring at walls to go to class; the second problem was the suicidal depression. When I did make it to class, I would sleep at my desk and take notes that were mostly nonsense scrawling.

Eventually I got diagnosed with narcolepsy, took a year off, came back a little more manageable. My senior year is all As. However, a college board probably isn't going to care about any of that. Any respectable program would take one look at my awful GPA and toss my application in the garbage. I also won't have any stellar letters of recommendation from professors, because, well, I was asleep, and a very bad student.

Sorry this is so disorganized. I don't know what to do or where to even begin. Which program should I choose? Should I even try???? Any advice is appreciated.",1588149647.0,2020-04-29 04:40:47

I quit my job a few days ago when a better offer came along. I told my boss about the offer the week before, he tried to counter it, but in the end he wasn’t able to give me the title change and increase in responsibility that I desired. I wrote a letter of notice to him that explained this and gave it to him in person with a verbal explanation also. 

Part of the reason I am quitting is because of my boss. I’ve been unhappy at my job for at least the past year. I was also just bored and wanted to learn more. I had no idea my boss or coworkers even thought I was an asset until I tried to quit and they said that I was the best person they have ever had in that position and didn’t want to lose me. I have been paranoid about being fired the past 2.5 years I’ve been there. My boss seems to only point out what I do wrong and rarely compliments me even when I am working my tail off. He promised me a lot of things that he never followed through with. He said no to most of my ideas and then was upset when I didn’t bring new things to the company. I mainly avoided him because his main form of communication was yelling. Everyone else at the company feels this way about him. That their biggest problem with the company is him. 

I just want to prepare for this exit interview. What do they typically entail? Should I be honest about how his bad communication skills is part of the reason I’m leaving? He is about to retire in a couple of years, so is there even a reason to do this? Everyone knows him in my industry and I want him to remember me positively.

During my spring semester of my senior year I applied to as many jobs as I could. My goal was to move out of state. When I graduated in May I didn’t have anything lined up so I continued to spend all my time job searching/applying. Then job market in my town is very scarce when it comes to PR/Marketing agencies, plus like I mentioned, I really wanted to move out of state anyways. 

Eventually it was October and still no luck so I knew I needed some type of income. I ended up landing a job as a counter manager for a makeup brand (basically a glorified retail job) and live at home with my parents. I was still trying to send out applications in the mean time to hopefully land something else. Then corona hit and I’m now on unemployment. 

I am feeling like I lost my chance. Here it is a year after graduation and I’m working basically a retail job (well was before corona). I feel like I don’t have a shot at a “big girl job” because to employers, I graduated college and then went into a retail job. With corona I feel like it’s near impossible because now I’m trying for an even smaller market with all the new 2020 college grads. I’ve been trying to work on things during quarantine to keep my skills up. I was looking to go into a digital marketing/content strategy type of position but I don’t know if I’m too far out of the game to have a chance.

I have a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in a liberal arts field, which no longer suits my interests and there are very little jobs available in that field, so it feels like a dead end. I have very little work experience too. I worked for only a year between my B.A. and Master's, and none after my master's since I had kids and other responsibilities so was parenting full time and the job market was at its worst of the financial crisis and museums and universities just weren't hiring.

Now my children are getting older and I would like to return to work, but in a different field. I just don't even know where to begin since the degrees I earned seem pretty useless now. Thankfully I don't have debt from my previous degrees (they were paid with scholarships). Would I start completely over with a second bachelor's in a new unrelated field? I don't think I would qualify to jump right to a second master's in a new field I have no previous experience in. I'm motivated and hard working but I do realize I'm quite old for starting over too. Any advice would be helpful on what may have worked for others or what suggestions you have. Thank you!


***Edit-- just wanted to come back on here to say thank you to everyone that took the time to comment and give advice and suggestions. I read every comment so far and appreciate it so much you'd help out an internet stranger! 

Some of you asked what my field was - I studied anthropology for both my Masters and BA degrees. I had actually entered a joint phD and MA program but after 3 years of it I realized it just isn't for me and didn't want to spend another 5 years studying something I no longer was passionate about, so I stopped after completing the MA portion. Problem is you can't really do much with a master's in anthropology. Lots of people who were in the program with me finished their phD and ended up working at Starbucks while they applied for jobs in unrelated fields that they would have been able to do without a phD.

Many of you mentioned mid 30s is not middle aged. I agree, you're right. I guess it just feels like it sometimes when it comes to career stuff. In your early 20s you're just embarking on a career path and have so many options, by mid 30s I should be way more established in a career than I am.

As a lot of you pointed out, my biggest issue is lack of work experience. I completely agree. I don't regret the decision to focus on our kids the last several years, as it was what was needed and best for our particular situation at the time especially considering the financial crisis and lack of openings, I'm just at a loss as to how anyone re-enters the work force after so many years out of it and barely any time in it before that. Love the suggestions to really examine with complete detail what it is I want to do and meet with people already doing those kinds of jobs to learn more. This is an excellent starting point. The last thing I want to do is pick something that I think I'm interested in only to later lose interest or find out I don't have any real trajectory to real world job with it.

Since then I've been doing everything they've asked, and all was well and good. The thing is, I have a masters degree in Human Resources, and a bachelors in Accounting, so I only intended the job as a temporary thing until I could find something in my field. They knew this, and were perfectly fine with it.

A VP for the company came by one day from the HR team and I spoke to her about opportunities. A few days later she came back to our office saying they had an open position for me and said she would speak to my boss about having me apply with her.

I told my current boss about it and she was FURIOUS. She instantly started going off about how this was against protocol, highly unprofessional, and how she would need to advise the HR manager against hiring me.

I was pretty devastated about it, until a few days later when the HR manager finally got her to agree to let me go for the new position. However, she is constantly in her office yelling at my new manager about how unqualified, disrespectful, ect. I am.

Now she keeps delaying my actual transfer date. I was supposed to have my last day tomorrow, but today I found out she won't let me leave until /maybe/ next week? Essentially she's saying she wont let me transfer out until they find a replacement, except I was told by another Admin Assistant (she has 2, I am the first secondary Admin Assistant they have, and honestly I am not needed. They do not have enough work for 2 people) that she has been tossing out all resumes she receives.

I wouldnt even mind having a longer transfer period if it weren't for the fact that she has been constantly in her office screaming on the phone about how ""disrespectful, unprofessional, rude, disloyal,"" and ""unintelligent."" I am. I feel like she's trying to fire me because I tried to transfer out of her department for a better job that I didn't even seek out.

At this point I am at a loss. She seems determined to make sure I can never leave. At this point, should I just quit and look for a job elsewhere? I can't work in this environment when the person I am reporting to is constantly raving about how unqualified I am at doing my current job.

Interesting she doesn't want anyone else to take me though.

Here are 3 reasons you'd never guess, that are keeping you from being advanced to the next interview.

1)  **You asked lame questions.**  Interviewers learn more about you *NOT* from the way you answer their questions, but from the questions you ask them.  Make them think.  Stump them.  Demonstrate you know everything there is to know about their co & what they do, through the questions you ask.  Make them fall in love with you through a single ?

2)  **You cared more about impressing them than uncovering their greatest need.**  You primped & polished, brought your heavy brag book and card stock resume, but you completely missed the mark on the fact that they are losing sleep because this vacant territory is losing 15k/day because someone's not there hustling.   

3)  **You were all arm and no follow through.**  You sent a canned email ""Dear Interviewer, thank you for your time today.  I look forward to hearing more about the next steps.""  Very, very, very few job seekers understand the critical importance of a proper follow up.  It is just as important as the interview itself.  I've had more clients than I can count, dismiss a candidate for either not following up at all, or sending a lame email.  Make it count.  Every jot & tittle.

So, I came to a place in my life when I realized I must change my career path. I graduated to be a teacher. I always wanted to be one because I love working with teenagers but I could never land a job because in my country this job is considered fancy (believe it or not) and you need to be a member of a political party, pay a certain amount of money ( basically bribe a principal) or have a strong connection and friendship to land such a job. I had none of those so I had to go and find another job. That is how I started working as a customer support and stayed at that job for 7 years (not in the same company though) because I don't have the luxury to be unemployed amd wait for the perfect job. I am almost 32 now and I literally DESPISE that job. I could never get a promotion because though I avoid conflicts and am helpful towards colleagues, I am also quite introvert and don't know how to 'suck up' to authority figures. However, I did manage to save a good amount of money (I do have other smaller jobs on the side that bring income too) and now I can use that money to follow my dream or go back to school.

The only problem now is that I literally don't know what I want to do. I am not sure I want to teach anymore, well at least not as a full time job. I would like to maybe go back to school and learn new skills but I just cannot figure out what job I would really like to have in the future.

I do like arts for example but I am realistic and I know that I am not very good and that I could never live off of that job. I also thought to start learning program languages at home because I like the idea of creating smth. I am a problem solving person, pretty good with details but then I read how I would have to spend years studying this and praying that someone will give me a job without a bachelour CS degree and I get discouraged. 

Since I am almost 32 I also feel that I really want kids and if I go back to college to earn a CS degree I am afraid I will miss out on having them. Now, I know some people will judge me but, I would really like to be a stay at home mom for a period of several years and use this time to learn a new skill at home or maybe take some evening classes. I actually like staying at home and I love chores. I don't mind cooking or cleaning, doing laundry etc... I even find it relaxing. My husband is a good and caring person but the problem is that he cannot aford to have me at home since he does not earn that much.

However, I have taken the plunge and quit the idea of having a customer support job ever in my life because I literally cannot take it anymore. My husband supports me in this idea because he wants me to have a job that makes me happy. Now I am living off of him and my savings while contemplating what to do next but can't figure it out.

I just don't want to be a jerk and not give my current job the 2-week notice that is common courtesy, especially because I know the department I was hired for is understaffed already.

But I also don't want to miss my opportunity with this startup company because quite frankly it pays a lot more, it's fully remote, and I can more or less make my own hours with the option to work OT if I want.

So how can I say this while expressing my interest in the offer?",1578788002.0,2020-01-11 19:13:22

But the biggest downside is my commute (1 hour each way on 3 different crowded and unreliable trains in NYC and no car). One plus is I get a lot of reading done! I would love to work part time there and focus on other creative pursuits but I need my benefits and I’m drowning in student loan debt so I also need reliable income (and lots of it). I just lose so much time in my life and am zapped of energy by the time I get home. So I stay up late to maximize my “me time” (mostly tv or artsy stuff) and then I’m exhausted in the morning. I lack the motivation to exercise or socialize much which I know is bad but I feel so drained all the time. I would love to live closer but it’s not an option right now because my partner’s son is in a great school district.

Hey everyone, I’ll get straight to the point.

I live in Sydney, Australia. Last year in 2019 I completed my Honours/undergrad in psychology, with plans for this year to be a gap/travel year before I then go on to do postgraduate study such as a PhD. Needless to say 2020 hasn’t gone to plan for anyone! 

So instead this year has been me living at home with my parents while I wait to see if the place I wanted to do my PhD at (Otago Uni in NZ) will be able to have me in 2021. It does look promising currently, especially since I’m also an NZ citizen. For most of the year, I’ve been working casually at a hardware store chain that I’ve been at for maybe 4 years. Due to COVID-19, I was actually working 2-4 days a week consistently from like March-August. 

In late August, I got offered a job via LinkedIn. The company works in disability services, and the role was described to be one where I was to create strategies and plans to help client’s with their challenging behaviour. However, as I found out later, the role is not just making plans for clients but also being the one to carry them out (eg meeting the client regularly for sessions). I only found this out because the company randomly mentioned in passing I would need a car for the role (which they hadn’t mentioned in the interview or in job description), which they explained was because I would need to drive to appointments regularly. I agreed to the role anyway for a full time salary of $78,500, working 3 days a week (so more like $47,000).

The job is 60 mins drive from my house, but is more like 75 mins each way with traffic. If I leave home at 7:45am I will PROBABLY make it there by 9:00am, but it’s not guaranteed. The company does not reimburse for tolls/gas unless it’s to and from an appointment.

Here’s what the role actually is. I get assigned a client who needs help with some challenging behaviour of theirs. I go to meet the client and get introductory information on their situation. I then spend time writing up a document that details all this info, and recommends strategies on how to help the client. Then, if appropriate, I do regular sessions with the client if one of the strategies involves that.

The problem is, throughout the process I feel the company I work for has not trained me adequately/isn’t concerned with me being new when they give me work. For example, in the 6 weeks I have been here, I have been assigned 12 clients. This is because the department in charge of assigning clients will assign you clients if you have even 2 hours spare in your calendar to do the initial appointment, with no regard to whether you’re new or whether you’re already busy. By the time my boss told me to fill my calendar up to avoid this happening, I already had been given all these clients. I’m not allowed to have the clients be reassigned either.  


So I have a lot of clients, and then I don’t have a lot of training on what actually to do! When I asked my boss what sort of strategies we typically use for X behaviour (eg verbal aggression) they replied “oh just use your own thoughts and look up on the internet to find things”. This was a major red flag to me because these are people with disabilities that need strategies in place to help them, and the company’s approach is to look it up on the internet as you go! In addition to this I have not been officially sat down and trained on anything-all skills and failures simply arise reactively when I ask or fail a task.

Finally, the nature of the job is stressful. Clients by definition have challenging behaviours which can range from shouting uncontrollably to groping support workers to violence towards others. 

As a result of all this, I have felt incredibly stressed in a way I’ve never felt before. I clench my jaw now. I feel physically ill a lot of the time, culminating in dry heaving and losing my appetite. Occasionally I have brief suicidal ideation driven mainly by feeling it’s all too much to deal with. Despite only working 3 days, I spend the other 4 slowly dreading having to go back. I feel behind on all of my clients and keep basically panicking that I’m going to let one of them down but I can’t stop to focus too long since I have 11 other cases. Work has not offered any support regarding this and seems to be under the impression that my situation is fine for someone new to the field and role. 

I really, really want to quit. I hate feeling tired and physically ill ALL the time. But my parents aren’t too keen on me quitting, both because of the economy and because I don’t have another job lined up save for the hardware store which they don’t respect as an actual job. I also feel guilty that I’d be just leaving my clients mid-way. I don’t know what to do on this...I live at home so money isn’t a huge issue, and I’m moving countries anyway in March next year.",1603700485.0,2020-10-26 04:21:25

We have a relatively small team that runs our assays and a supervisor that organizes the design. He’s also new—right out a PhD program, but I believe he’s worked in biotech before. He’s been working here about 7 months. 
Everyone else works really well together. I really like my colleagues and can rely on them to be efficient, capable, and communicative. Because the company is so small, this is really crucial to things going right. 
However, my supervisor seems to have alienated the rest of my coworkers with generally sloppy work that results in everything having to be redone many times over. This has been costing the company a lot of money and the CEO has steadily been getting more and more frustrated with him. Aside from this, he personally is difficult to get along with, tending to be passive aggressive and often pushing responsibilities onto others. Admittedly, I felt sort of bad for him receiving a fair amount of hostility, so I tried to work with him and tell his what I needed, but it’s mostly resulted in me cleaning up his messes and working significantly more hours because of it.

Earlier today, I put in a written complaint (along with another coworker) outlining this, as well as specific dates and times things went wrong, emphasizing that I find everyone else reliable and wonderful to work with. 

The CEO is apparently “thrilled” about the letter according to HR, noted that it was written in a professional manner, and personally came down to thank me for submitting the letter and ominously suggested that “things are gonna change around here”.

I think I’m just anxious because I’ve been trying to navigate this stuff for the first time. Would anyone have insight about what that means?

I had an extremely grueling job in fast food before this one so literally anything would have been better. However, when I first started the glaring problems with the company started to shine through. Mainly the lackluster training to begin with.

The manager at the time was never present, leaving me to deal with a highly abusive senior employee (I'll call her A). She talks smack about everyone through chat and email, reports everything everyone is doing wrong to our bosses, withholds information, the whole bit. She is the literal worst. The definition of a narcissistic psychopath who gets off on hurting others reputation.

Eventually the original boss left and for whatever reason was replaced with someone who has literally no clue about our policies or what we do in our department. He is also never present and micromanages us through email and announces our mistakes in front of everyone. He blatantly ignored my email expressing concern that A was committing slander against me.

I used to have a workload that kept me busy throughout the day, but then the new manager's close friend got hired and started taking over about 80% of my original workload. She also gets away with everything because she is the boss's friend. Never ever gets called out on mistakes. I was then given the important responsibility of managing relationships with one of our most valuable clients. During my 3 month review, I was told I was doing great, and I should have more confidence in myself. (self esteem issues abound due to the negative reinforcement from A)

Then, out of nowhere, said important responsibility was snatched out from under me and given to the previous employee who managed it, due to ""The importance of needing someone more knowledgeable."" My manager stressed that it was nothing against me or my work ethic. I had a hard time believing that. I cried pretty much the entire day. How was I supposed to be knowledgeable about this responsibility if I was barely trained on how to carry it out?

The manager said I had more important responsibilities coming my way and he would be glad to go over them with me, I told him sure, but I never heard from him nor have I received any additional work (besides closing work orders, which is incredibly simple)..

Long story short I am working at about 20% of my original workload. I feel undervalued and unappreciated. I fear of having my hours cut due to this, And I have expensive rent and a car payment. I need advice on what to do. Thanks.",1573598368.0,2019-11-12 17:39:28

I'm one of the stubborn few that still believes in the Good ol' days and i'm finding it very difficult to conform to the whole social media thing.  Don't get me wrong, i think social media is great and that it has its merits, but honestly, sometimes i could care less about what my ""friends"" had for dinner, vacations, MLM recruiting efforts, and charities begging for everything under the sun.  With that said, i have quit social media and i'm blissfully unaware of all the drama caused my ""friends"" posts on Facebook.

Not long ago, i started talking to a recruiter that was having a career fair in my country, and she sounded very interested on me.  I have been actively looking for a job (reading ads, applying online, requesting meetings, etc.) so for a senior recruiter to be interested on me, that's a big deal.  We chatted both on the phone and by email, made an appointment to meet at the company's career fair, and all went great.  I was told that as soon as the contract got approved, to expect a phone call for a potential opening.  I was also told that if i wanted to know the status of the contract, to follow the recruiter on Linkedin because that is the best most fastest way to contact her.  Problem is, i don't have a linked in account!  I also do not want one.  A few years back, i had started to build my profile on it but 2 seconds after it went ""live"" i got contacted by my ex which absolutely freaked me out.  It was then and there that i decided to forget about the whole linked thing, and i instantly deleted my account.

I don’t need health insurance or anything like that but I do want to keep my job. Right now because I’m still in my first trimester, my job is not affected.

There is talk that I will be promoted to a brand new position in the company so this also makes me take pause in telling them. This new position is ideal because it’s behind a desk anyway, but I’m afraid if I say something before I get it, I won’t. I should throw in that the work is mostly seasonal, so while I would have a job full time, the busy season wouldn’t start for a couple months after the baby is born anyway.

&#x200B;

Informative title , I know. I'm a pretty transparent type of person and don't mind being open and honest about the experiences I've had in my life so far. I apologize if this is long but truly appreciate anyone that takes the time to read. 

I'm a female , 28 years old , born and raised in the US , and have a long history of drug abuse. I've been sober for 4 1/2 years which will probably always be the best decision I've ever made in my life. I started using at age 10 , dropped out of high school at the end of my junior year and continued my destructive path until I was 24 when I got sober. In between all of that , I caught endless amount of drug charges , went through rehab and jail countless times , lost my father suddenly 2 weeks before my 23rd birthday and dealt with ( still do) a very broken family. Needless to say , a career was the last thing I was ever thinking about through these times. I managed to gain 3 felonies on my record ( all a direct result of my addiction ). Possession charges and a receiving stolen property charge ( I used my ID to sell something that was obviously stolen) During my years of active addiction I had pretty common jobs ; waiting tables  , selling glasses at a kiosk in the mall , telemarketing. Hated them all. When I got sober , a friend of mine was a crew leader for a construction maintenance cleaning company and got me a job. The hours were long , exhausting and my boss was a very opinionated woman who I somehow really got a long with but didn't always agree with the way she handled some business. After about 90 days at that job , I got promoted to Crew supervisor and had my own crew of about 6-8 people to run everyday. I didn't necessarily love the supervisor part of it all , but I did like delegating tasks. I also love manual labor. After about 2 years I left that job for a behavioral health tech position working in a drug and alcohol treatment facility.   I really thought at that time that this was what I wanted to do. I wanted to eventually get my GED and go back to school to become an addiction counselor. What ended up happening was me being taken advantage of at that company and made to run psycho educational groups every single day with no schooling behind me and only having a little over 2 years sober. I got burnt out , and I got burnt out quick. I became extremely checked out and ended up making a very impulsive decision ( which I don't regret but have absolutely learned to never do again) and quit my job without anything else lined up. The stress of the job fell off my shoulders but then the stress of life and careers jumped right on. I was jobless for the first 3 months of 2018 and finally found a job through a friend in the 12 step program I was in doing Underwriting for a Loan company. I had no idea what any of it entailed and was extremely nervous because not only do I hate numbers of any kind , but i'm horrible at math. Anyway , I'm still currently with this company and although there's no part of it that I really do enjoy ,and sitting at a desk all day is driving me nuts ,  I would never abruptly leave like I did the last one. It's a very flexible job , my commute is 10 minutes and my boss is extremely understanding when I need time off. Nonetheless , it's not something I want to do for the rest of my life. I recently , about 2 months ago , obtained my GED and now am trying to navigate what I want to do with my life. 

&#x200B;

I feel lost in the sense of never really having that chance to figure it out when I was a teenager because I was getting high. I have felonies now , although they are all about 8 years old at this point. I don't want to waste my time going to college for a degree and I ultimately won't be able to get a job doing because of my past. I also hear horror stories of people going into extreme debt for a degree that they can't even get a job for. I'm not willing to do that. I've been trying to do some research about trade schools but I also don't know if my body can handle doing that for the rest of my life. I had surgery on my ankles when I was a baby & have always had issues with being on my feet for long periods of time. I love cleaning and organizing and attempted starting up my own business but it fizzled out for the most part and i'm just not sure I want to own a business. 

&#x200B;

This is a lot and all over the place but it's a pretty good idea of how my brain functions on a daily basis. I'm not getting any younger and I can't help but feel like i'm running out of time.

527,Can you help me exit a job I have been in for 20 years?,157,jxrpsu,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jxrpsu/can_you_help_me_exit_a_job_i_have_been_in_for_20/,75,"I am looking for advice - I have worked at my current company for 20 years. I helped build it from the ground up and have been the CEO / Owners right hand. We have developed a close personal friendship and I have considered him to be one of my best friends. A lot has changed over the years - both in the company and in my personal life. I started as a single woman who had no issue with a 50+ hour work week and now am a married woman with a young child. The CEO has made it clear he expects more from me and needed me to pull more weight than 40 hours a week. He is super goal oriented and if we are not moving at warp speed towards the goal he feels we are 10 steps behind. As in true 2020 fashion, things began deteriorating for me there this year as I went to 100% work from home while others stayed in the office and have kept things propped up. Over the summer I began to have what I will call a nervous breakdown. I began thinking about work obsessively, but was unable to act on the things I knew needed to be done. During one of these breakdowns I contacted the CEO and explained some of the responsibilities that fell under my umbrella slipped and that I felt I should work towards the development role he had been wanting me to work towards and step out of operations. I also clearly needed a mental health break. He was initially supportive, but quickly moved to make sure my tasks and knowledge were designated to other staff members. Upon my return from my break all of my duties had been reassigned. I had a large project I was in the process of wrapping up. He asked for me to write a development plan and submit for his review - which I did. After I wrapped up the project and kept asking ""whats next"" and he avoided my question I could see the writing on the wall and knew I was going to be let go. Yesterday he asked to meet outside of work and i knew what it was. I know it was very hard for him, but he explained he was burnt out and looking for an exit strategy himself and he was letting me go. He explained he's not interested in developing the business any further. He is offering a severance package and wants to make sure I am taken care of and asked what I wanted, which I needed to think about. After our meeting I of course overanalyzed every word and realized while he may be burnt out he is not going to stop developing the business. He has asked me the various ideas I had for development. He is going to implement those strategies - and just get me out of the picture. While I am of course really saddened by this I also know its probably for the best. I am on the cusp of 40 and know if I dont stay there for the long haul my window of opportunity is shrinking. I guess I am looking for advice on the following:

\- What should I ask for in my severance package? While I earn over 6 figures, he earns over 7 figures a year. I have been instrumental in building a recurring revenue model within the business than is going to continue to gain steam long after I am gone. I have no pension there - only a self funded 401k. He has a company pension in which he puts over $350k a year into his own retirement. I don't want to take advantage of him, but also don't want to short change myself. I just bought a more expensive home just 2 months ago :/ Things would have been way easier in my last home.

\- Any words of wisdom you may have. Truth be told - even though I saw the writing on the wall - even though this hasn't been my dream job - I am scared as hell of whats next.",1605917037.0,2020-11-20 19:03:57

529,"I'm a manager and I don't know why but working for just profit feels wrong, can you help me out?",157,efwhmo,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/efwhmo/im_a_manager_and_i_dont_know_why_but_working_for/,118,"I have tried to conceptualize wtf is wrong with my situation, but I don't really know. I think at the core of it is that as a manager I am consistently told I should be doing what brings the most profit for the business, but yet I feel like sometimes doing what is most profitable is also being a dick to my employees. Exploiting them as much as possible is the most profitable for the company.

I feel like my boss is not a person who seeks to pay people for the work they put in. He seeks to avoid giving raises as long as possible until his hand is forced, which is shitty because its basically him trying to exploit you as much as possible for as cheap of pay as possible EVEN when he recognizes value.

So my problem is two fold:

1. My perspective makes me feel like my boss relatively takes advantage of labor surplus to exploit workers for pay. We are being paid way less than him yet take on nearly just as much stress for our work. He takes trips to europe constantly.

2. The system of competing companies encourages us to under pay everyone in order to have the most future investment. Future value at the cost of current people and their happiness in their lives. How is that fair to the people of today?

I'm being pressured to ask for a higher quality of work from my employees when I already think they are underpaid and that they won't get raises even if they do more. How can I sit there and tell them to do more when they already seem underpaid to me? Hell minimum wage buys so little. The thing is, capitalism seems to be a big game of who can skeet their workers hardest. On the one hand, my current owner of the company I manage for makes too much and does too little. Frankly it is not good for a company to overpay anyone because long term profits go down from a lack of investment. How is it that every company can underpay all of their employees and that be whats best? 

Like these kinds of things don't even make sense to me in a moral sense. How can it be moral for us all to be underpaid? I'm just so confused when I think about business. How is it that my employees lives blow and yet I am still being asked to ask more of them?? Someone please explain that too me. I sit in my room trying to conceptualize it all and it feels like every time I think about it I'm just getting lost. Like I cant even sort it all out because none of it makes any sense. Why is our society this way?? If my workers are being underpaid in my opinion, yet globally others are willing to do the work for less, than I need to be getting more out of them. Yet they are already miserable. I am asking them to be more miserable. It is miserable.

How is it that my boss can take home a big fat stack of cash and that be fair? I just don't get it. How can bezos be paid 100000 per hour and it be fair? His work could not POSSIBLY be THAT stressful. Talent is being made happy and yet we are claiming that by paying talent it is intrinsically worth it to us. It's worth it to overpay Bezos because we get our value back? How could that be possible?

I can't even freaking figure out if my employees are overpaid or underpaid because they are miserable and life sucks on minimum wage in the US, yet people across the globe are willing to do their job for drastically less because they have never known better. It just makes no sense. How can my employees be broke nearly 24/7 and yet I need to be asking them to do more work than what they are doing?

I want to help people. I don't want to live a happier life than anyone else, but I don't know how to evaluate what is fair I guess. I have noticed how if you give people an inch they take a mile. They always accept handouts because many are not in it to be fair, they are in it for themselves. They don't give back when someone is too generous. But in order for me to not be too generous, I need to be putting a dollar amount on their work and idk how in my workplace because I dont think the work is worth it for the pay, but apparently it is? It's just I get confused. I'm trying to get fight some sort of unfairness I seem to perceive in the world and the people who have so little but I can't pinpoint what the unfairness is exactly. It seems like the market is supposed to accurately pay people right? Its like...is there even something to be done? If so what?",1577401883.0,2019-12-26 18:11:23

I’m trying to post more on LinkedIn. Recently, my photography work got accepted into a gallery in a big city in my state—a big deal for me. Because of the current COVID-19 situation, the gallery ended up being online. I wanted to make a post on LinkedIn about it, but the catch is that my photo is technically NSFW (you can see a very very small portion of an areola in it of my female model). There are other photos in the gallery that are also technically NSFW, but it’s kind of the nature of the beast aka it happens in art a lot. Neither my photo nor the other ones I have seen are sexual in nature. 
I’ve shown my boss and my coworker the photo and they thought it was amazing, they weren’t offended by it. But then again, for context, photography is my hobby, it’s also not directly my day job. I’m a tech writer, and I sometimes photograph products, but that’s it when it comes to my pro photography work. On the flip side, I was in a previous gallery before for my photography work, and that previous gallery I did post about on LinkedIn.

I need some perspective on this situation. Thanks in advance!

I started a new job literally yesterday and here's what's up so far-
I accepted a remote job as a project manager after a very quick interview process (one week from call to offer and over Xmas week) interview process all over the phone. Post acceptance, the tell me they need me to start ASAP and push my start a week sooner than I offered (they pushed for even a week sooner but I was oot) so I've just started. 
In my preinterview on-boarding they tell me that they'd like me to come to the corporate headquarters outside of Chicago for a couple of days- all fine so far.

I get this email from the admin assistant like  'you'll fly in take a bus from the airport and stay in our corporate apartment for your trip'- ok weird that they don't use a hotel and not keen on an hour bus ride but still not worried just yet. 
Next email from my new boss telling me what flight to book on their corporate website. We are going to be meeting at the airport and commuting together and also staying in this same corporate apartment together. No car. Same space (thank God we have our own rooms and bathrooms within the space).  Ok- starting to get anxious.

Im still just rolling with it on Sunday. I met her at her gate (for the first time I've ever seen her) at O'Hare and she's like 'we've got 15 mins to catch the bus are you ok with running?' We ran across O'Hare to catch this bus with minutes to spare. She talks to me nearly the whole bus ride -some pleasantries and some asking me about my previous role. We get off the bus catch an Uber to the shared apartment. It's late at this point- there's no food in this 'stocked apartment' besides beer and oatmeal. We order food (she paid). I ate and went to bed exhausted from the day and the non-stop talking. I went up to my room to go to sleep. 
Monday- Woke up and got ready. We left this apartment and got an Uber to Starbucks for breakfast. We went to the office where we had a small conference room where we spent nearly every minute of the day together- we even took bathroom breaks together (how fun!).  
We do a bit of onboarding and starting process review and she gets visibly annoyed when I ask questions about process flow (learning it's her way or no way) and she tells me it's not my job to worry about the controls that I've always worried about in my previous roles. They are doing their own waterfall/agile hybrid process  I don't know anything more than the customer facing info on this product and she's really not inclined to expound- not your job- stay in your lane. I explain that it helps me understand what I'm doing if I understand the process and she shoots me down again. She said I need to take 'big steps back'. Whatever. I can be a talking head- dropped it..

So she leaves for a bit to have a meeting with her boss and comes back and starts pinging and calling her pms (this starts at about 3 Central) that they need to report numbers before EOD for some budget report. They don't respond she starts calling people. I'm trying to read SharePoint stuff because effectively my training is now over and I'm just another person in the room. About 5pm she's still working and says she be working late. She was weird about giving me a key to get into the apartment. Then pinged some other out of town people who were in the office to have me go dine with them- I didn't ask for her to do this. After some talking my way out of their group I was able to leave and get an Uber to a different place where for the first time I was alone in 24 hours. 
She texted me while I was at the restaurant to check in... Literally left the office at 530 and this check in was at 7. I decided to leave the restaurant because apparently I'm being babysat and came back to the apartment around 8-830. She's on the phone with her boss like 'she finally came home'.  She is sitting in our living room space (no TV's in any other space) working and is still literally calling people who will be my peers to send her data. I sit on the couch across from her and she said she got a 'weird vibe' from me and asked what was up.... (...l) 

She said she had concerns about me (in my life have never been an employee to have concerns about)- I explained that because of my experience my default is to monitor and control my teams work... AND this is DAY ONE. She's at this point still calling her employees, my peers to get them to send her different reports and such. She said to someone as I was in the room 'would you bet your job on that report' ?  Tells me she is often on the phone with her boss at midnight and 2 am. I mentioned work life balance and said I I don't really sync or look at work after I'm done for they day and she responded with 'so after 6 I'll just have to call your personal cell, right?'

 She presssed on the vibe thing - I said I had concerns about calling employees (literally one was on her way ooo and she was asking her to stop her commute to get her information) and felt this situation was strange - and from my experience this seems to be a process issue- either her employees aren't reporting properly or the data collection is flawed and then stepped back and said it was my first day and I only have a very limited view or her budget crisis situation and went to bed.

Would this all be not so bad if I wasn't trapped in a random apartment and had a hotel room where I could come and go as I wanted without feeling under a microscope? Is this just a really dumb situation? I reached out to my friends about it and one said I should be running away and the other said to collect my paycheck and do whatever they want. I will be leaving this office Wednesday and will be working remotely after...
It's 5 am, I can't sleep because this awful situation and even worse this stupid uncomfortable bed. Really starting to feel like this is all by design and they are trying to break me.(would that even be a surprise anymore? Lol) 

Sorry for the length. Looking forward to your thoughts. Thank you again!",1580239510.0,2020-01-28 14:25:10

My colleagues have grown to dislike me and they've always looked down on me because I'm 30 years younger than all of them. I desperately want out because I don't fit in. They're all older and still mentally live in the 1950's, meaning since I'm a female in my late 20's, I'm expected to clean up after the older people and take pride in being a secretary. It's absolutely miserable. I get no benefits, pay is low, and my commute is horrendous at over an hour every single day on the city bus.

I've been applying to jobs since the beginning of the year and can't get calls back from anything other than more dead end jobs. I've applied to some out of desperation but realized I shouldn't take them. I have a Bachelor's degree in Business and I do freelance journalism work, I have good internships and other work experience. I'm no ""newbie"" to the workforce, but I constantly feel like I am since I can't land anything more than dead end secretary work.

I want a creative job like in writing or film production (my Business degree focused on the Entertainment industry) but it's impossible to go out and meet people since I'm extremely burned out from my current job. The job is so boring that I can't stay awake, and I've become irritable, but I've never treated any of my colleagues badly. I get home and I'm mentally done. I can eat and watch a couple youtube videos, then I'm done. But I still stay up too late because I don't want to go to sleep, knowing I'll be getting up to go back to this horrible job. I've been severely sleep deprived since last year.

I applied for a job at a bank literally across the street from where I live and I hope I get it. While I don't want to do banking, at least it will get me out of where I am and it's steps away from where I live so there's no commute. There's nothing in my city that I want to do and I've been trying to network online and do freelance work online. I would almost have to move out of where I am, but it's impossible since I can't get a job that pays enough for me to move. I feel like I'm stuck in a never ending cycle of misery.

I work for a financial advisory company and today my boss came around and said its now mandatory that he follow everyone on social media to ""make sure we arent promoting *company name* on our personal accounts"". 
To me, this seems like a pretty large breach in my personal life privacy? To the point I'm thinking of deleting my social media platforms. Not necessarily for the sake of me posting inappropriate things, but moreso because I dont want my boss knowing about my personal life in any regard? I keep my personal and work life as separate as possible? 

Is this actually a new rule? Is this allowed in general in any work place? I've searched for SEC compliance rules specifically about social media and everything that comes up is just about the businesses social media platforms.. not the individual employees?

Also, if there is a better sub to post this on, can you please direct me there? I'm not sure the best place to ask this.

Thank you in advance!!!

Update: first I want to thank everyone that has weighed in here. Mostly everyone has been really helpful and helped me figure out this place is probably not for me. Hes always been a little bit on the inappropriate side and this just pushed me over the edge I think... I'm going to keep my eyes open to new positions in the area.

 I decided if he persists on this issue I'll deactivate my Facebook and tell him I deleted my snapchat. I think it's easier to hide a snapchat than a Facebook because you need the actual snap username and mine isnt recognizable as being me. Also I'd deactivate my facebook rather than change my name or block him because I have a really really uniquely spelled name and theres like 2 profiles that come up when you search for me (my own and one I had in mide school lol) 

I've not accepted any of his requests and have not added him on anything, it's almost the end of the work day and he hasn't come to me about it or sent any emails through the office asking. I'll give it a few days and if he asks for my snapchat I'll let him know it's been deleted. Aside from snapchat I only have Facebook and LinkedIn. When I first started at the office he tried to friend request me on Facebook and I declined it so now he cant add me and I cant add him. 
A random coworker sent me a friend request minutes after my boss came into my office and asked for my social media information. Idk if that's relevant but I figured I'd make it part of the update.

""Hi is this (name)? I'm calling from (company name) to let you know you're rehired. 

We've had problems with others not answering us, so we called from a separate number to increase the chances you'd pick up. You are unable to reject an offer of employment without losing your benefits. If your performance is unsatisfactory during the time we're rehiring you, you will be fired, and you'll receive no benefits.

We've received a loan which is contingent on rehiring our old staff. We acknowledge most you are now making more money from unemployment, but we won't be matching it. We want to inform you that the loan only covers the next few months, and we'll likely have to lay you off again when the loan runs out, so please make necessary arrangements. Unfortunately, this would also be when the additional unemployment benefits from the CARES Act goes away, so you wouldn't be receiving any extra money than either unless new laws are passed."" 

Everyone is upset about this, the feeling is that we were tricked into working for a worse version of unemployment, and we have no leverage.

She kept repeating how much of ah interest she has in this field and how eager she is to learn etc, she mentioned she’s easy to mould. I was really impressed with her attitude. 

However this role is meant for someone with more experience. You need to be technical and she doesn’t have the experience. No doubt she’d definitely put in the effort it takes to learn but, yeah. That’s my pickle.

544,HR issued then rescinded a disciplinary notice to me bc they failed to read the dr note I submitted months ago; how protected am I? should I be looking for another job?,160,ctpb19,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ctpb19/hr_issued_then_rescinded_a_disciplinary_notice_to/,23,"I really thought this company was going to be a long term company for me. I'm working an entry level position but just started classes to move up in the company (a promotion requires more education). I even applied for tuition reimbursement for the classes I'm taking.


I have multiple health issues and checked 'yes' on the ""Do you have a disability?"" question when I was applying for this job. I've been working there for over a year. I was sick for two weeks last year due to smoke inhalation because our area had severe wildfires. I was then placed on a PIP for attendance and told that if my absences were due to medical reasons, I could submit a doctor's note for intermittent medical leave and my attendance would no longer be considered a performance issue. However, I didn't have health insurance until January, so I did not get a doctor's note until a few months ago. I submitted the doctor's note at the same time that I took 4 days of continuous medical leave and the doctor signed one note for both leaves.


Important to note that my manager who was handling the PIP transferred to a different location after I submitted the doctor's note. My supervisor was then promoted to take my manager's place. I had an annual performance review with my supervisor after she got promoted to manager. It was a positive review and I was given a raise. I mentioned the doctor's note at this time and my new manager said she had not yet been made aware of it. I thought that was odd but assumed they were going to fill her in since she had only just been promoted. 

Then in July, a friend of mine died very unexpectedly. Stress exacerbates my health conditions and I missed 1.5 days, then another day for her wake. The lead manager at my office was aware of my friend's passing as well as a few other people I had to tell when I called out. 

The next week, I had a meeting with my manager, my brand new supervisor, and a woman from HR who was running the meeting. They placed a disciplinary notice in front of me which I barely had time to read but it had 3 dates listed on it, dating back to my first attendance warning. 

I said I had a doctor's note on file for intermittent absences and that I was under the impression that was all that was necessary to satisfy the PIP I had been on. HR said I only had the note for the continuous leave I took, and I told her it was on the same note. When she found it, she confirmed that it was on there and swiftly yanked the disciplinary notice away from me. She then chastised me for ""not keeping my managers in the loop"" and also stated that she didn't know if they could accommodate me based on the leave my doctor recommended. She said she would follow up on the issue.

Since this has happened, my motivation to work has substantially dropped. I was putting in extra hours, volunteering to work shifts that needed coverage, and working on my school work to move up in this company. Now I feel that my head is on the chopping block and they are looking for any excuse to fire me, even the death of a friend. I'm stressed all the time, it's affecting my sleep and my health, it's affecting my job performance, and I'm terrified of calling out. I have one more month before I finish my class and am eligible for the tuition reimbursement that I applied for from the company. I'm trying to stick it out until then at least, but I'm wondering if my intuition is correct and I need to give up on this company and look for a job someplace else. And what happens if they say they can't accommodate my medical needs?

546,Unhappy with my degree | How to move out of copywriting / advertising ?,156,go32r2,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/go32r2/unhappy_with_my_degree_how_to_move_out_of/,120,"I’m about to turn 26 and I’m tired of feeling unmotivated and directionless.

I studied advertising and journalism with plans to be a copywriter, and I realized it’s not the path for me. I worked really hard in my classes, interned at a major ad agency, pulled all nighters for my school’s ad competition, and read every copywriting book I could get my hands on. By the time I graduated in 2016, I had no desire to work in the industry. I’ve been trying to figure things out since. I’ve jumped around from different jobs and plans, and now I’m unemployed and living at home. I’ve become pretty depressed because I always took pride in my drive.

I don’t want to rant *too* much about what I dislike about copywriting because I’m trying to move forward. I learned a lot about myself in college, became more introverted, and I don’t feel like I value anything about the ad industry. For example: I don’t care about trends / social media / ads in general. I value people who are genuine and don’t like the culture of selling and people pleasing. I tried to suck it up because I know this is a privileged ‘problem’ to have, but it’s hard to pretend, especially in an industry where there are so many passionate people trying to break in.

Anyways, I’m looking for ideas or suggestions on what I could do next and how I can use my time now. I consider myself a creative, but I’ve developed a lot of non-work related hobbies and passions and don’t feel the need for my job to be that ‘cool.’ I think some variety would be nice, though. I’m hoping to find something with decent pay and more stability than the more creative routes I’ve considered (freelance writing, photography, etc).

Some background info and ideas:

* Since graduating: I worked at a restaurant while getting an ESL certification and student teaching, but my plans to teach abroad fell through. Then I worked as a writer at a very tiny marketing firm for a year and a half. I moved to NY and have lived off of temp agency work and sporadic freelance writing and photo assisting. I was interested in learning about becoming a photographer (I’ve had some photos published in magazines), but ultimately there isn’t enough stability and too heavy of a barrier of entry for me.
* I feel ‘unmotivated,’ but there are a lot of things I am interested in (work and non-work related). I’m really interested in people/ethnography, language, visuals / art / design / clothes, psychology, music, and nature / conservation. Obviously no job will encompass all of these things, but it’s a start.
* This isn’t a priority, but I’d like to be in a less conservative work environment if possible. I am a photographer and artist and like a lot of esoteric music and film. It would be great to not feel like I’m hiding at work.
* I’ve got job ideas related to my interests but most of them don’t seem that viable, especially now. I care about money and stability more than I did before, and I’d rather pursue freelance writing and photo projects outside of work.
* I’ve been interested in and looking into tech / coding related jobs, but I feel like this has become a go-to for people not knowing what they want to do. Is this worth looking into? Is it realistic to start learning now and find a job soon?
* I've been working on side projects to keep some motivation. I'm working on a website / social account with a friend right now highlighting style and aesthetics in jazz. I'm working on a long-term photo project, making playlists and a fake ""radio station,"" and hoping to take some drawing and French classes for fun.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. I need to figure something out soon since I lose my health insurance in the next couple months, but I’m trying to break this pattern of lulling around. Any ideas, suggestions, reality checks, etc are welcome!

TLDR: Majored in advertising and it doesn’t fit my personality or values. Out of school for four years jumping around and am now unemployed. What can I do next?",1590116959.0,2020-05-21 23:09:19

They unsuccessfully tried to have my GD review removed (and a coworker got a legal notice of defamation about her review, lol) so I occasionally check up on their page to make sure it's still up. The profile is just brimming with fake, vague, five-star reviews. You know the type. I report them all and reached out to Glassdoor's customer service team to let them know, but I doubt they care.

This week, I got a LinkedIn connection request and vague intro direct message from someone purporting to work at this company with a very obviously fake profile picture. Reverse image search confirmed it was a stock photo. I called them out in response to the message (just pasted the tineye link) and they immediately changed the picture but didn't respond. I then image-searched their new photo and found it again (they had reversed the stolen image this time). I reported the profile to LinkedIn as fake and hopefully it gets taken down.

But as the title says, the company and specifically its CEO has a growing thought-leadership presence in legit publications. He's a contributor to Inc and Forbes, which all link back to the company website, and the company has been featured in a local tech pub.

564,So What SHOULD Candidates Say On Interviews?,148,8hnlfs,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/8hnlfs/so_what_should_candidates_say_on_interviews/,22,"## So What SHOULD Candidates Say On Interviews?

Several years ago, I was having a meeting with a hiring manager at a firm in the city. It was going great...we had really connected, we were telling jokes, etc. It was just a real good conversation. The meeting was winding down and he had asked ""Anything else to add?"" Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a statue of Peter Griffin.Me\- ""I noticed you have a Peter Griffin statue.""Him\- ""Who?""Internal Monologue\- ""Hmmmm....ok, so obviously not a *Family Guy* fan. I should probably just move on.""Me\- ""The statue over there.""Him\- ""Oh, someone bought that for me.""Internal Monologue\- ""I should probably just move on.""Me\- ""Oh I get it! It's because you look like him.""Internal Monologue\- ""Why are you still talking?"" Having a coherent, meaningful conversation is hard enough. But with the pressure of a career involved, successfully interviewing can be darn near impossible. I know what you are thinking\- ""Interviewing is easy...I'm great with people."" Confidence is great, but it will only get you so far. As well as the interview is going, you can just as easily talk yourself right out of the job. Sure, the person interviewing you may be smiling, but you never know if they're just being polite. Official feedback may be\- ""We really liked you and your thought process, but..."" but internal feedback may be\-""I am stupider for having heard that."" Interviews, for the most part, are structured and simple enough to prepare for. Anyone can answer specific and factual questions about their experiences and career. It's easy when there is a format and the candidate is led down a path of responses. But there are two key areas that are difficult for candidates. When you get to these ""open\-ended"" portions of the interview, that's where panic can set in. As a recruiter, the two questions I get most \(other* than How do you sleep at *night? and What is it like to not* have* a soul?\) are

1. How do I answer when I am asked ""Tell me a little about yourself?""
2. What do I say when I am asked ""Do you have any questions?""

Simple right? In theory, these are very easy questions. But the more you think about it, the easier it is to become confused and disoriented, resulting in a panicked mess of silence. Or worse. You could compare the person you are talking to with an overweight buffoon.

## Tell Me A Little About Yourself

Keep in mind, the interviewer isn't asking for your life's story. The key words are ""a little."" But which part should you share? That time in 4th grade that you totally rocked it at Field Day in the tricycle race? I know I know, it shows determination and coolness under pressure. GRIT. Technically this would be better suited for a LinkedIn video recreation. So what IS the interviewer looking for in this answer? They are really just looking to get to know you, your personality, and what details you find relevant to your own life. They want to know your conversation style. Don't overthink it. The more you can relate it to your career, the better. Keep in mind, they really don't want to know ""you"" during this initial meeting. They just want to know ""work you."" The polite, sterile, first impression you. You can dictate the first impression you make. Practice it...don't just wing it. Remember\- there are technically no ""wrong"" ways to answer this question. Keep it short, keep it sweet, and keep it RELEVANT. Some examples\-GOOD \- I've lived in this area my whole life. On a personal note I enjoy reading, fishing and traveling with my family. On a professional note, I've been in recruiting for more than 15 years now and it's a passion of mine. I love staying current on the latest techniques by following X, Y, and Z online.BAD\- I do a great impression of a hot dogGOOD\- I spend a lot of time in my craft studio. I fancy myself quite the amateur woodcarver. Sometimes its good to get away, enjoy the quiet, and just focus on the best way to create something. I find that it keeps me refreshed for all of life's challenges and keeps the creative juices flowing.BAD\- \*knocks over water and runs away\* Also, confidence is great. But you don't want to come off as arrogant. For example\-Interviewer\- I just love a good cup of Starbucks. You like Starbucks Adam? I love a nice venti soy blonde latte. What's your drink of choice?Me\- I like a large coffee.Interviewer\- You mean venti.Me\- No, *Venti* is 20. Large is large. Infact, Tall is large, Gra*nde i*s Spanish for large. Venti is Italian. It's the only one that doesn't mea*n l*arge. Congratulations, you're stupid in 3 languages. Just keep it simple, basic, and most importantly, safe. Who you are, what you are all about, and why your career is what it is. Don't just rehash your experience and your career....talk about how you the person have evolved in the career and what you get out of it.

## Do You Have Any Questions?

The answer is never ""no."" Never. You want to show interest. You want to show that you are thinking long term about the role, the company, your career. A ""no"" shows a limited view of the role. There is zero chance you completely understand everything discussed about the role, the company, etc. When you say ""no"" it usually means\-

1. I just want this to be over because a\) I need to get back to work b\) I need to make the train c\) My meter has been up for 25 minutes and my car may be getting towed right now.
2. I can't hold this bodily function in any longer.
3. I am not a forward thinking person. I didn't hear anything during the interview worth following up on. I am a person of limited imagination and thinking exhausts me.
4. I could care less about this particular job. I just want a job. This job would do. Kindly stop talking and offer me this job. I need money.

### Questions You Should Ask

1. Why is this position open?/What happened to the last person in the role?
2. How does this position contribute to the long term success of the company?
3. What is the average length of time someone spends in this role?
4. What is the growth plan/career track for this role?
5. Typically, what are the biggest challenges one encounters when starting this role?
6. Based on our conversation today, what parts of my experience do you envision being the biggest assets in this role?
7. Based on our conversation today about my experience, do you anticipate any difficulties of my getting up to speed in this role?
8. What is your estimated timeline for hiring for this role?
9. If I think of any other relevant questions, would you be offended if I reach out? Do you prefer email or call?

By asking these questions, the candidate is able to:

* Exhibit an understanding of what the role entails.
* Understand and demonstrate their experience fits in \(and doesn't\).
* Show they understand the macro impact of this role on the company.
* Show they understand the micro focus of the role as a self\-contained job
* Have a general idea of when the role will be filled.
* Obtain a reason/permission to follow up with the hiring manager.

Having all of that info from the hiring manager at the end of the interview allows the candidate to have the best Thank You letter ever. The candidate can reinforce ""why"" they are a fit for the role. The candidate can address the potential shortcomings the employer has identified. And the best part is, they have some time to think about it to put the best message out there and leave the best impression with the hiring manager. Without asking those questions...when you tell the interviewer ""Nah, I'm good. No questions,"" your follow up letters look like ""Hey, remember that time when I interviewed? That was awesome.""Odds are 1\) It wasn't awesome and 2\) They don't remember.",1525729557.0,2018-05-07 17:45:57

What do I do?,145,e8bltx,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/e8bltx/i_am_riddled_with_anxiety_every_day_because_im/,35,"It’s almost all I think about any day. The littlest things will make me anxious. Some back story:

I’m a front end web developer. I live in a medium sized city, about 2 hours from a major US city. I’ve been fired from my last 3 jobs and it has riddled me with anxiety. 

1. When I graduated high school, I got a job at a small agency as a developer. I was their first employee, and at 18 that was a lot to handle because immediately i was made everyone’s “superior” that they hired after me. I managed the sales team and dev team. We hired an intern who’s uncle was extremely wealthy. She had a horrible attitude problem and made working with her not fun. After multiple complaints and attempts to talk to her as well as stress from missing a deadline, I eventually snapped and yelled at her. I didn’t swear at her, just yelled. She was so offended by it she complained to the owner and threatened to quit and I then got “laid off” to “protect the company” from her scary uncle. 

2. I was burnt out from the headache that job was and went into IT. I got a job at a local hospital and got fired for being on my phone too much. What was funny was that I was not on my phone any more than anyone else was, in fact we really didn’t have much to do other than be on our phones, but being 19 for whatever reason I was singled out. I will take the blame on that as I shouldn’t have been on my phone at work.

3. Worked at a fortune 50 company in IT. Worked there for 3 months and was fired. Absolutely no idea why. At that point, I was so scared of getting fired I just simply went into work, did my job, and left. My job was in a call center answering IT phone calls. Everyone I closely worked with liked me, never had an issue with anyone. One day on a Thursday I went in, my badge didn’t work, and all my stuff was in a box. They refused to tell me why and to this day I have no idea why I got fired. 

Today, I moved to this new city and am a developer again. I work at another agency and it’s a good job. I like the people I work with. I want to start my own agency one day and this is a great opportunity for me to learn more about how bigger agencies operate. 

However, this agency is going through some “growing pains”. They’ve fired 4 people in the 2 months I’ve been there including the person I replaced. This is not a good feeling. I get super anxious all the time. All day I am riddled with anxiety. It hasn’t gotten to the point where it effects my performance, but I’m terrified I’m doing something wrong always. If my boss messages me in a weird way I freak out. Today I swear she was acting weird and it had freaked me out. I know they will continually bullshit me and act like it’s fine until they fire me because the girl they fired on Friday didn’t even know it was coming. I’ve made attempts to check in and ask how things are and they say i’m doing great but I don’t believe them. The last 2 jobs I had management said how awesome I was doing and then they fired me days or weeks later. 

This is not healthy but I don’t know what to do. I can’t keep sitting here with this much anxiety because i’m scared to get fired. I don’t have any savings because every time I get fired I have to drain whatever savings I have to not be homeless. I finally have paid down the majority of my credit card debt but the idea of having 0 savings and no other income is scary. I don’t know what to do. This whole firing people is a huge red flag.",1575935233.0,2019-12-09 18:47:13

I have absolutely no skills or talents. I can't see anything positive I have to offer and I'm sure there will ALWAYS be plenty of people better than me for any job position, so there's no chance any reputable place would hire me.

I am still employed, and intend to quit upon accepting an offer elsewhere. 

Over the span of a couple months and about 20 applications I finally heard from a company. The business is a large company based in my city with locations all over the US and Canada. They wanted to get me on the phone ASAP for a screening with the company recruiter. That went well and I was scheduled for a phone interview with the hiring manager. This also went very well. The call was originally scheduled for 30 minutes, but continued for about an hour. The next day I heard back from the recruiter that they wanted to schedule an in-person interview.

I was told what time to arrive for the interview and was told to “plan for an hour or little bit longer”. I showed up right on time and the interview began promptly. I nailed every question and from what I could tell, they were very impressed with my experience and potential. It was all smiles and good vibes from the moment I walked in to the moment I left. I never once looked at the clock because the conversation was fast paced and smooth. When I left I looked at the clock in the car and it turns out the interview lasted just shy of 2 hours.

The next morning (this morning) I received a call from the recruiter with good news. They were extending an offer to me! Naturally I was ecstatic, but the recruiter quickly turned the conversation to an issue that had come up in my interviews. She told me the hiring manager expressed to the recruiter that I went over on time during both of my interviews, and that if I wanted to work at this company I would need to “nip that in the bud” because this company takes meeting schedules very seriously. She went on to give a light lecture about time management and learning to read the room.

I was completely caught off guard. Generally speaking I think I’m pretty good at room reading and receiving social cues. I was also taught for years that it can often be a good thing when an interview goes over its allotted time since that usually means they like what they’re hearing. I’ll remind you that the room was all smiles and good vibes. They spent about 3/4 of the time asking me specific experience related questions, and left the remaining time to allow me to ask them questions of my own. 

This whole thing is making me think about what kind of culture this business might have. They lectured me before I even worked for them. It’s made me seriously consider not accepting the offer. 

Am I over reacting? Is this normal? I’ve worked in a professional environment for years so I know how to operate and communicate in an situation like this. Should I reject the offer and wait for a different opportunity? I’m not in a rush, but I look forward to leaving my current job.",1577286185.0,2019-12-25 10:03:05

582,Is it better to take short term underemployment or continue unemployment and focus on getting something better?,148,j71e7e,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/j71e7e/is_it_better_to_take_short_term_underemployment/,45,"Hey all. So as the title suggests I'm in a bit of a pickle and just looking for advice.

I'm recently unemployed and like many others am now job searching.

I've been offered a role in my field. The issue is, its a basic entry level, low salary role. I have 5 years experience so on paper I am way overqualified. My last job wasn't that well paid so the salary is relatively equal, but it just doesn't represent a step up or what I should be earning with my experience. I'd definitely be 'underemployed'. 

I'm really stuck because on one hand I think take it because the job market sucks right now and it would be a relevant job. Also I could continue my job search after starting this role? 

On the other hand I know that by taking it I'll have less time to dedicate to a job search. I also don't want to be seen as a 'job hopper' but my previous job I was there for 5 years so I guess I could highlight that? Do you think it would be easy enough to explain if I was interviewing for new jobs months after starting? 

For a little more context, I live with parents so it's not like I'm desperate to take any job to be able to survive/pay bills.

**Quick break down of my situation:**

My only goal after graduating university was to travel. I grew up quite poor and so never travelled or had a passport as a kid, so seeing the world was my absolute number one priority.
Since then I’ve lived in New Zealand, California, Vietnam and Cambodia and paid for it all myself doing basic retail and hospitality jobs, mostly for charities. It’s been wonderful and nice but now I’m back in England and suddenly faced with the reality of being pretty much unemployable for anything other than the most basic of work, and it’s a bit depressing going for with 16 year olds of minimum wage jobs. I totally accept it as the price I’ve paid for travelling for so long, but I’d like to get going on a real career as soon as possible! 

**(You can probably skip this next bit but slightly more info if you’d like it and I thought it was kinda well written):**


My parents are a bit like sims that you’ve maxed out on the ‘kind nurturing and dependable’ stats and totally dumped the ‘successful career advice’ ones, which is great for making me not a serial killer but totally unhelpful in terms of being any help in my current situation. The world of professional employment seems like it might as well be the moon for how achievable it seems.
At the moment I have the exact same feeling of unbridled terror as I did the first time I tried to cross a road in Hanoi. Fortunately, once I’d got to grips with how Hanoi worked it became my favourite place in the world, and I have no doubt having a professional career and life will end up the same way! I just really need someone to grab my hand and guide me through the 6,000,000 loud beeping scooters of confusion between me and the questionable street food vendor that in this terrible metaphor represents my career.


I’m working part time in a vegan wholefoods co-operative at the moment which is a nice work environment and allows a lot of freedom with when and how much I work, but I’m definitely ready to start a career and try and get employed somewhere that has long term security and means I’ll be working with adults rather than 16 year olds!


**The actual important bit! (Finally):**

I have an undergraduate degree in Radio production and Technology (Bsc) which is pretty useless so I’ve just been looking into perhaps studying either a conversion course or just going on to do a masters that will make me more employable at something. I’d love no nonsense professional advice on what masters would be achievable with my degree and would equip me to start work in a particular field upon completion.


My degree is a science based degree but it only vaguely touched on coding or anything like that and it was a hell of a long time ago, but I wouldn’t be adverse to studying that more! My only real concern at the moment is I don’t want to waste more time. I don’t want to study a masters/conversion course that just puts me back in this position in 1 or 2 years time!


Becoming a teacher is definitely an option that is up for consideration, but I know it’s arrogant to think I could just ‘fall into’ teaching as a back up option, so any advice from teachers who have maybe been in my situation is great too!


**TOO LONG DIDN’T READ AND BECAME INFURIATED:**

What I’m getting at is that I am ready to start my career and quite open about what that career could entail! My only concern is that I want to study/pursue something that will really help and progress my career prospects. My biggest fear is going to study something then end up back at square one after graduating! What can I work towards right this second that will give me genuine prospects and options in 2 years time?

I just want to make sure I’m on the path to somewhere as opposed to wasting time getting older and I have nobody in my life to sit me down, tell me I’m a dissapointment and explain the options and the pitfalls in front of me, so you have to be my dad reddit. Get your shit together.

I  am 47 year old. I am digital designer ( this includes UX / UI / Web /  Marketing ). Year ago i was fired from last job to be replaced by 20  y/o. Since than I sent over 1000 job requests, with almost zero results (  not more than 2 even replied ). As for this career, I think its dead  for me. Ageism is a thing in this field, and I personally was never very  good. Perhaps a very average quality designer

I dont think there is point bashing my head against a brick wall any more. I need change of profession.

Problem is as 47 year old. Design is only thing I ever done. This is further  amplified by the problem that I can not do extensive physical jobs due  to age/medical situation.

Another big problem is that due life choices I live in a country that uses non-Latin alphabet. I speak the language quite ok, but I dont read or write (  any good ) So I am practically unable to read or write. ( I am trying  to practice it, but its just not going very good ) - While working as  designer most of jobs are for EU and USA markets, so that was never a  problem.

So... Please help me.  
I am completely lost. I have not been working for over a year. And I must change the profession. But to what ?

Here are some pointers:

* I dont want to do anything more with any artistic type of work.
* I can not do overly physical work due to age
* My reading and writing is poor ( in local language )
* I am very good with computers ( both tech and coding layman knowledge )
* I have high academic education
* I am good at talking/ interacting with people ( or even kids )
* I am almost broke ( if suggesting to open some business )",1600364383.0,2020-09-17 13:39:43

Normally, not having gotten a review by now wouldn’t be that big of a deal, except for the following:

I started on a Monday, and on Friday I was offered another position that was more in line with my background, and told that it would pay better as well. Of course I accepted, and after about 3 weeks I assumed the new role. 

Once in the new position, I was instrumental in literally saving the department from collapse, and it is now more profitable than its ever been. 

I was instrumental in helping collect over $35,000 from a client due to a past connection with them (I’m not in finance or collection, and through my connections was able to clear up some communication issues that got us paid quickly) 

At my 90 day mark, my manager was terminated. This has nothing to do with my specific department as he wore several hats, but it did require my partner and I to work more independently. We now manage our department with minimal supervision. 

I’ve also brought in two successful referrals, who are doing well. I’ve brought in guests to speak with management about opportunities to expand and strategies for making that successful.

591,I've gotten to the point where I cant figure out what I actually do for a living anymore?,144,dd80de,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dd80de/ive_gotten_to_the_point_where_i_cant_figure_out/,32,"To help understand how I got to this point, and where my confusion lies: I'm 31F, and I have a trade certificate in Drafting, no degrees because I'm dyslexic (I do want to try again). I also have no experience outside of the company I work for. 

I started in a small company that has grown about eight years ago as an intern, working in the design department and call center.  Over the next few years, I became a drafting and sales assistant. I then focused solely on Drafting. I developed the drawing office around the companies needs. After about 3 years, I found myself in the position of drawing office manager, out of ease more than ability probably. I was allowed to hire a couple of intern draftsmen, and they became so capable that I started to have a crazy amount of free time. 

I started providing illustrations, and renders to our marketing department as they were looking for a freelancer to do this, I taught myself using freeware, without costing the company anything. The technical guides at the time were elementary, so I started creating documents and illustrating them to help sell our products more effectively. The CEO started using me for his own projects, and I started communicating with suppliers and assisting with developing products offshore. I stopped drafting entirely and had to hand over the drawing office to someone else.

After about 5 years in the company, I was promoted to a product manager, and given a specific line of products. The only other person assisting with this was one of the executive's very capable cousins. About 2 years ago, we hired an R&D manager, who happened to be the sister of one of the Executives. We get on like a house on fire, and she had several years of corporate experience, a masters in her field and helped me polish up professionally. She has somehow become my unofficial manager, though none of the higher-ups wants to say it out loud. I'm happy with it, the entire department runs smoothly owing to her.

The problem lies in that we are under-resourced. It's just the cousin, manager and myself as well as a few strategically placed offshore colleagues.  They keep threatening to hire more people but never do. My manager started using me for product design and rapid prototyping owing to my history with drafting skills, adding to my workload. Then she tackled the technical documentation process, and I suddenly became the liaison between our department and marketing, developing these documents. Including outlining the content, writing, illustrating, researching, data collection and sorting. She edits and we have a back and forth over the document until its ready to send to marketing.

So now I'm managing and developing a product line. I'm designing products outside of that product-line, providing technical support and writing as discussed above, and after all that, my pay-slip actually says R&D manager.  The only thing I don't do other than editing is manage budgets, which the CEO does himself.

So what am I? A Product Manager? R&D manager? Or am I really a Product designer? Maybe a Technical writer and illustrator? By trade, I'm a Draftsman. Do they fall under some all encompassing job title. Do Product managers or R&D managers usually do this stuff? 

A job title seems like such a small thing, but I want to go back to university, it is not going to happen with the workload. I also want to renegotiate my salary. Not because I necessarily want more money (which I do!), but because I if they keep getting the milk for free, why buy more cows?  I adore my job, but my current salary is along the lines of a mid-level draftsman, which doesn't reflect my (perceived) value to the company or based on my official job titles, regardless of the qualifications.  Can I even make comparisons given that this all is so dependent on the niche I've created for myself within the company? And the company has done so much for me as well but after 8 years, at what stage do I stop paying it forward to them and start focusing on myself without been ungrateful?  If I could just figure it out.

It has been a proud couple of months for me - I both turned 40, and started a fantastic new job that I had been targeting for a very long time, after finding myself unhappy and depressed in a dead end job in a separate industry at 35. I was able to do this without taking a pay cut.

It has been a long, and at times painful journey fraught with difficulty, but is it one that might offer some value to someone out there.

Would anyone be interested in reading such a story?

Edit: Ok I will write it up. Will need to be tomorrow morning though. I would like to do a good job of writing it, and I need some sleep.

**OK here we go:**

Firstly, I would like to acknowledge that my experience will not be applicable to everyone. We all have a different situation, and some of the things I describe will not be possible to replicate. That said, it is my hope someone will get something out of it, even if it is just motivation rather than a strategy or practical advice. 

Secondly, I also need to recognise that luck played a part. I would like to believe that some of the luck was created through hard work, but at certain points people did things for me that they really didn’t have to.
I will try and keep it brief, but my story takes place over a long time with lots of twists and turns, so you might want to grab a coffee! Anyway, here goes.


Five years ago, I had painted myself into a career corner. 12 years working in a technical role for large Telecommunication companies left me with a very specific set of skills in a profession I had no passion for. (I don’t want to divulge too much detail about the role, as I don’t want to offend anyone who does it). I had grown very competent at it, but it wasn’t for me. Added to this, the only way “up” was through general management, which held little appeal for me, and in an area where people traditionally retired after doing the same role for 40 years or more, there was also very little opportunity for development or movement.


Anyway, one day I had an epiphany (won’t go into detail), and decided I absolutely must change something, anything.


Trouble is, and I think there are a lot of people in this boat – *I had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do.*


My first step was to look around for other jobs at the company I worked for, as I figured it was probably practical to make an internal transfer in a company that trusted me, than go in “cold” elsewhere. I had a good relationship with my Line Manager, who was very understanding and supportive. He didn’t want me to leave, but he understood that I was unhappy and that in the long term it would be no good for him or for the team to try and make me stay. I suppose you could say that my first stroke of luck was having a good relationship with an intelligent and supportive Manager. 


We devised a plan. Under the guise of “professional development” in learning about the company, he arranged for me to spend a day with other teams, based on job descriptions I saw on the company Intranet. All had partial skills matches with what I did already, and on paper a role within any of the teams would represent meaningful career progression. I did this about three times, and I certainly learned a lot – about what I didn’t want to do. Here was a lesson learned for me, no matter how amazing a job description sounds, the reality can be much different.


I kept going. Then, a stroke of luck: while this was happening, my team were “treated” to a training course. It was the first piece of official training most of the team had had for nearly a decade, so we were looking forward to it. I was on a specific piece of software we were migrating to, and it was very hard to use. It was so specific in fact, that the trainers had to be flown in from Europe at great expense. 


They “phoned it in” as they say in the US. The trainers were poor, and one of them was offensive and rude, particularly to older members of the team who were having trouble picking up the software. I ended up assisting, as I had used the software extensively before and had an affinity for technology. I managed to defuse the situation, (aforementioned trainer was going to get punched).


Afterwards, I fed back to my manager what I thought of the training (awful). He challenged me to do better. I had some good feedback from the team, and was already mentoring new starters, so I thought – why not? I was convinced I could not do any worse. 


Our contract with the training provider was not renewed, and there was a training gap, so I volunteered to deliver a course. I had no idea really what I was doing, I only resolved to do two things: Ensure everyone learned everything they needed to, and treat everyone in the room with dignity.  


It went brilliantly, and I loved it. It caught me by surprise, I am normally a very quiet and reserved person, so public speaking in front of colleagues should have terrified me, but it didn’t. My parents had warned me off education as a career prospect early on, as they were both teachers and said there was no money in it. In the Public Sector, this was (is?) certainly true. I was determined to do make this work however, and decided to do some research. 

*What if there was some way I could combine something I was good at (technology), with some I actually cared about (education), and not take a pay cut in the process?*


*Technical Training* was what I found, and that is what I do now.


Of course, I was only half way there, I had found a potential career, but I wasn’t actually doing it yet. I applied for some Training Roles, but got no responses. It became evident that I needed the experience. It was at this point I had another knockback, and a blow to my confidence. My Manager set me with a meeting with our HoD. My mission was to convince him that our department needed a full-time trainer, and that I was that person. I was naïve however, and didn’t realise that what I needed was a bulletproof business justification – this was after all, a penny counting operational department. For all intents and purposes, I was laughed out of the room. Awful moment for me.


I didn’t give up. My company was big enough that we had our own training department, and I kept my eyes open for job opportunities there. I wanted nothing left to chance - when an opportunity came up I wanted to be 1st in line. To that end, I volunteered for every training delivery opportunity possible. I dressed professionally so trainees felt they were getting a “paid for” experience (they weren’t). I did my very best to ensure the training was fun and engaging, everyone left the training room armed with what they needed to know, and I made sure they felt 10 feet tall. I created an online community using our corporate intranet, recording and uploaded lots of tutorial videos to it which people found useful. At this point some of my colleagues thought I was a suck-up, but I didn’t care, I was too far invested and had a plan.


I played the long game. It took maybe 6-9 months of this, but my reputation grew. Managers from over the country started asking for me specifically to deliver training, and they negotiated with my Line Manager to free me up from my day job so I could.


Eventually, I got the attention of the training department, and I interviewed for the next available position as a Technical Trainer. They were very impressed with the work I had done on my own, and sought feedback from the people I trained – which (I assume) must have been positive. My strategy had worked, I was the person they wanted!


After the interview process, I was offered the role - at 15% less than my current salary. To train people to do the role that I was currently in. I went from elation to disappointment in a heartbeat. Another awful moment. My Wife and I were saving every penny for a house deposit, and there was no way we could take that kind of income hit. 


Despite all the hard work getting me to this point, I had to tell them no, I could not accept a base salary cut. I needed them to counter. It was a gamble, and one of the most difficult conversations I have ever had.  


It was a calculated gamble though. I was miles ahead of the other candidates, and I deliberately left salary negotiation as late as possible in the process in case they low balled me. I figured, the longer they went without completing the hire, the stronger my negotiating position became. Especially if they made the foolish move of informing the unsuccessful candidates before I formally accepted.


Unbeknown to me, this also paid off. The hiring Manager became desperate, and drove for half a day to the HR Directors Office to convince her that he needed me for the job. He was successful, and had a whole new job band created just for me, so they could pay my current salary.


**Success!!!** Everything up until this point took about 2.5 years.


For the next 2.5 years, I set about learning my new field. My story is already pretty long, but I need to mention that this part was also quite difficult. I enjoyed the work for sure, and was good at it – but going from the guy who knows everything, to the guy who knows nothing was tough. Learning from people 10 years my junior, reporting to people 5 years my junior. It was humbling, even a bit depressing at times.


I did a lot of graft however, learned everything I could, as fast as I could. I had fantastic professional development opportunities too. As a result, I outgrew the role. Now armed with a whole lot of relevant experience in my CV, I recently started a new job, in a new company, in a more senior role and I finally feel like the change has been a success. 


If you have made it this far, you can imagine it was a long road. There is actually a lot I have left out, but this post is already too long, so I’ll just say thank you for reading and if you have any questions I am more than happy to answer.


**TLDR:**

-	Use any research method you can think of to find something that you both have an affinity for, and care about.

-	Find a practical way to go about making a change.

-	Don’t give up when you experience setbacks.

What you wear, how you style your hair, what to eat for breakfast, how your going to get to work, what your doing, etc. These choices can be traumatic to some. I know for me, it has been. 

Don't you find it funny that one wrong decision or choice can affect the outcome of your whole day, and it shouldn't be like that. How we ultimately decide what our motives and intents are at every turn and section of the day help to make up our life. Life is just a journey of wrong decisions, right decisions, bad choices, good choices, and missed opportunities. 

I've always wanted to make the right decision. The right decision for me is the one that progresses me, and opens up doors to my future. But the reasons I associate as a right decision are different from how another person might see their ""right decision.""

596,Stable job I like ($50k) or risky job I love ($70k)?,144,cxcqia,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cxcqia/stable_job_i_like_50k_or_risky_job_i_love_70k/,49,"Stable job I **like** ($50k) or risky job I **love** ($72k)?

First, I’m 40.

I’m currently at a **stable job** (technically no job is stable I know), in a position I’m comfortable in, with a boss that likes me and would fight for me (and says he has plans for me with the company), in a company that has been around for 20 years, with decent benefits & flexibility (periodic paid lunches, somewhat flexible schedule, etc), I literally have 0 complaints about this job. Job is even easy too, I don’t see myself ever getting fired and could be there for years to come (won’t love it, but won’t hate it, it's nice, I like it)... It’s stable.

But there’s another **risky job** that pays more ($72k vs $50k) in an industry I’m super passionate about… but there’s risk because it’s a startup company, in an industry where others didn't make it, so it may not be around in 3-5 years.

It’s typically easy for me to make hard decisions, but this one has just got me torn. Everything is pointing to taking the high paying job doing something I love, but the uncertainty of the future is making me 2nd guess myself. And I would hate to burn a bridge with my current employee.

Any advice here? And if it helps, here’s some background about me:

**ASL**: 40/m/Idaho  
**Debt**: $70k left in mortgage, $7k left on car, $7k left in Credit Cards  
**Kids**: No  
**Married**: Yes, she doesn’t work  
**Priorities**: My credit is 500\~ and I desperately need to get it improved asap by paying off my Credit Cards (reasons I won’t bore you with)

Does it suck not having benefits and extra perks? Yeah, but the mental and physical toil I was in forced me to go to the doctor more anyways.

599,I joined a small company 7 months ago to head up marketing. CEO secretly onboarded another marketing person. What can I possibly say to CEO?,142,jhkouw,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/jhkouw/i_joined_a_small_company_7_months_ago_to_head_up/,46,"Hi all. I joined a \~15 person startup in March (my 5th+ startup) in their first marketing role. I'm looking for advice about how constructively talk to my boss without quitting, because I am absolutely beside myself at him secretly hiring a second marketing person who doesn't report to me.

\-----

In my interview, I firmly outlined my expectations for the role. I've been burned before and would **NOT** have considered the role if the responses in my interview were not great. But the CEO (my boss) answered them all positively, volunteered that he knew nothing about marketing and said he wanted me to handle all of it.

I'm think I'm doing a stellar job under the circumstances. The company is poorly run but I'm getting cheap qualified leads, maintaining visibility, creating appropriate marketing material, doing a TON of operations tasks that I explicitly did not sign up for. I get minimal feedback, but what I do hear is good. Working 50+ hour weeks as is everyone else here.

My salary is not bad, but I'm not getting some of the benefits I was promised during the interview. I feel like I have no control over marketing, as the CEO takes us on tangents each week and rewrites most of the copy that I am cleared to publish, even though he's not a native English speaker. My coworkers just mentioned that they deal with similar broken promises, but it's their first startup and they're happily chugging along in the belief they'll be millionaires. Also, turns out we don't actually use our SaaS product and it will never work even if developed for another 20 years. So a lot of bad work environment things but I can generally grin and bear it.

A few months ago, my boss asked me to outline plans to do many marketing things that he fantasizes about doing. Our established and 100x larger competitors take multiple departments to execute these plans. We have similar-sized competitors to model ourselves after. But I gave my boss a best case time estimate for what a great marketer can achieve, and he insisted it would take 5% of that time. Ugh. I guess not meeting really uninformed marketing expectations is where my boss would take any issue with me (common issue in this field). The boss mentioned that he was looking for marketing advice and would be asking marketers to agree with his view (sooo any marketers who give honest feedback are out).

Fast forward to 5pm Friday, he offhandedly mentioned that someone had already started work in our other office (offshore) to handle marketing. Presumably this new person lied to my boss that he can do 10x work I do. Of course my boss eats that up. This person doesn't report to me and didn't introduce themselves to me. I didn't even get to say a perfunctory hello during the interview process because I didn't know they were being interviewed.

Crazy that this was hidden since we spend hours per day in detailed companywide Zoom meetings; since when I asked about onboarding an intern, my boss was having none of it; since I asked to be kept apprised of marketing hires (which I shouldn't even have to ask) and he said I would be.

It could be that my boss misspoke at end of day and this new person is handling marketing only after handling other tasks, but I doubt it.

I barely started applying elsewhere (daunted by the job market and work exhaustion). But I think I need to leave ASAP? I can deal with day-to-day suckiness. However, bringing me on to handle marketing, then intentionally hiding a new marketing hire from me, seems like something that any self-respecting person can only have zero tolerance for. I'm really stunned and thinking over ways to claim unemployment somehow.

Despite everything, there is some hope - the CEO can be pleasant IRL, I've had worse jobs, and partially thanks to me we are almost profitable. But again, I simply cannot work there if I was told I was in charge while I'm actually not.

\----

I can't afford to just quit...can I ask for a letter of termination so that I can receive unemployment? Or is there some way to continue on and explain to my boss this is wholly unacceptable? Thanks for reading.",1603617121.0,2020-10-25 05:12:01

So I've relied really strongly on the external structure of a workplace environment and co-workers around to keep me focused. Since that doesn't exist anymore, I'm falling apart. I'm making more mistakes, being less productive, pretty much a slew of fireable mistakes if I wasn't working in an industry that doesn't really fire people.

However lately, he's started making jokes about my mistakes... Saying things like ""you messed up... again? :)"" on a daily basis. I can take a joke, but the same one made every day when I *am* trying to find ways to create structure and stay focused is really wearing on me.

I’m wondering what to do about it. Should I let her employer know about it? I would want to know were I the person who hired her as I would not want someone on my team who misrepresented her credentials to get the job. On the other hand, I’m sympathetic because had she used her own title in her profile, it would list several titles of “manager” followed by “coordinator,” which looks like a step backward.

It was fine at first, but I've been struggling in it for over a year. I'm 26F and educated with a Bachelor's Degree. I've outgrown this job because all I do is copy papers and clean the office. The commute takes an hour even though it's only a few miles (traffic is horrendous). They pay is low and I get no health insurance benefits. I've developed IBS and my depression has gotten worse due to the stress of it all. The long commute, low pay, and disorganized management. My boss always gives me last minute work in the last 15 minutes of the day that needs done immediately. I sit there doing almost nothing all day, even though I ask for work to do they say ""We don't have anything right now"". They wait until the last minute and it's stressing me out so bad. I also can't sleep more than 5 hours a night and it's agonizing.

I've been applying for jobs since January and only got a call back from a receptionist position at a hair salon nearby. It was a joke I applied to it because I figured a crap job would call me back and they did. I've been applying for jobs one step above admin assistant, because I don't want to do this anymore, but I've heard nothing.

I've met with my uni's career department for help and they worked with me. They said my resume and cover letters were great. But they've left it up to me to apply for jobs (I wish they would be recommend me somewhere). Applying online is hopeless and I have no connections.

I still live at home since I have no money to live on my own, so it's financially okay for me to quit the current job and work harder at finding another one, except I pay full price for health insurance. But my parents don't have extra money and consistently need my financial help. We all work together just to keep an apartment and buy food and pay bills, paycheck to paycheck. I write freelance for some websites so I can use that to explain the gap in my employment. I'd like the most to write for a living, but working full time doesn't give me enough free time to pursue it. I've considered part time work, but I will probably need a job that provides health benefits.

I'm scared to quit because I'll lose income to pay for health insurance. I can't afford the penalty at tax season. I'm completely miserable and depressed and hopeless. I have no idea what to do since I'm doing my best and it's not resulting in anything. I don't want to be an assistant forever when I went to university and I'm getting older.

603,I've been repeatedly told I'm doomed and hopeless after being out of the workforce for 16 years. Is this really true? [ pls no bully :( I come in total peace and humility ],143,cx4nr2,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cx4nr2/ive_been_repeatedly_told_im_doomed_and_hopeless/,61,"Thanks for clicking on my post!

So here's some information for you in case you're willing to point me in some useful directions. Thanks in advance for reading and thinking about a stranger's troubles and foibles.

I have a foreign degree in economics but I don't remember any of the coursework and I'm not good at it anyway. I wasn't good at economic theory and belief systems back then either. Plus I had little to no idea about what to do during exams because the questions made little sense to me. I was far better at understanding business and some finance concepts from a few of the classes I had to take. I grasped them intuitively much better than my classmates who did well at economics.

I haven't worked in 16 years. I'm afraid I will not be getting into the how and why of how this transpired. Please rest assured however that there is no incarceration or any other type of untoward/illegal/immoral/scandalous issue involved whatsoever.

What I have been doing - as and when I could - is taking many for-credit courses online at community colleges and a local 4 year college. I've been taking them as a non-degree seeking student. These classes have been in business and law, as well as in art and design. I have also taken non-college non-credit classes in art. I have excelled at all these classes.

My past jobs, before the 16 year period of unemployment, involved customer service and low-level admin work. I realized that I have a peculiar talent for observation of customer behavior and a strong curiosity about its patterns, going so far as to conduct little sensory experiments to see what customers responded to. I also found myself fixing hold-ups in customer service and employee performance with little basic solutions such as a flow-chart, behind the counter for the cashiers, that described types of glitches that the ancient cash machine would throw at us while checking out a customer and how to work around those glitches. 

Ideally, if I had the money and time that I needed, I would be studying human perception and sensory processing, and applying it toward usability, UI/UX work, interaction design, service design, customer experience design etc. But alas, I do not have that time and/or money :/ I am curious about studying these fields in Germany though given its free education and the quality of German design. But since I have no idea how to get there, it remains a total fantasy at this point.

What I can do as proven by the coursework I've excelled at:

- Write a fairly decent essay

- Analyze a given situation fairly decently

- Grasp legal concepts and apply them to scenarios (while being unable to memorize - please see section below)

- Understand at least fairly well how the fields of business and law work with each other

- Understand visual composition 

- Convey visual information

- Take on complicated topics in business, science and design and find a way to synthesize them and produce a fairly decent design product
 
This semester I will be learning how to write a business plan.

What I CANNOT do:

- Drive

- Stand for longer than 30 minutes. Walking is totally fine.

- Lift heavy objects

- Do math calculations quickly or in my head

- Memorize a ton of stuff and recall it quickly

- Speak Spanish - which in my town at least is a definite requirement for any and all menial jobs and even many white-collar low-level jobs

CAVEATS:

- The law classes have NOT been from any law school and I'm NOT working towards a JD or any paralegal certification. (Should I?) They're from community colleges.

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in design software such as Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator etc. 

- I do NOT have any training whatsoever in commonly used office software like MS Office.

If you've read thus far, here are some questions:

- Ideally I would have a remote/online part-time job.  What fields would such jobs fall under? What skills do such jobs often require?

- What should I learn in the short term so I have basic job skills for a white-collar job? 

(I'm not seeking white-collar out of classism or snobbery, please see 'What I CANNOT do section' above)

- What should I aim for in the long term so that I can build career skills while I work a part-time job?

- What kind of job should I be looking for while I build larger, long-term career skills?

- Do you have any pointers on what type of career I should go for? 

CODING BOOTCAMP:

At this point, it seems like standard advice to tell someone to 'get into' a coding bootcamp. Is this a reasonable course of action for someone like me?

I'm not sure what to go back for though, and it's a difficult situation to try and go back because I need to work full time to support myself and my fiancee (her mental health struggles have been a barrier to her working up to this point, I am our sole income). I'd like to have a career that's more intellectually interesting, but I'd like a more stable schedule (roughly 40 hours most weeks, preferably). I have a bit of a STEM background from the advanced program I went through in high school, and think I might be interested in a career in biology or botany, but I am open to other fields of study, and I do enjoy being outdoors, but it seems that any outdoor job tends to have a more unpredictable schedule and/or less pay than I would prefer. What do y'all think, is it worth my while to explore other options, or should I just get over myself and stay where I'm at?

I am 32 Years old and have just been fired today.  I was fired for an incident that occurred 7-8 years ago.   This topic is not about why i was fired so i will just leave it at that.

I have been with this company for my entire adult life. Part time while in university, and full time immediately after graduation.  8-9 years working there full time.  You could say its a government job where most people who work there stay for life, and that was my plan as well.

I have a degree in Finance and graduated in 2010,  it was difficult to find work in my field back then, and I had the opportunity to get a decent paying job out of school so I took it.

I started as a cleaner and took a few relevant courses to become a technician/mechanic within the company.  Sadly these courses do not qualify me for anything outside of my previous work. 

Now I am unemployed, and the only education I have is finance degree from a decade ago with zero relevant experience, and some random trade courses my previous employer decided were relevant.  Essentially zero technical qualifications.



**I have no idea what I want to do with my life at this point.**  I am recently married, and we had our first child 2 months ago, so the timing could not have been worse.  But I do have several months to a year worth of funds saved.

I am open to trying anything really, from going back to school, to starting my own business.
My previous work was easy but brain dead and I did not really enjoy my time there, it was just to pay the bills.  
I'm hoping this time around it can be different.


A few things about me.

* I'm a nerd, logical, introvert, somewhat interested in technology, and I play alot of games.

* I am no good at things like cold calling, sales, public speaking, and grammar. 

* I consider myself a fairly capable individual.  And I am confident if given the chance I can excel in whatever position I apply for.  I just need the opportunity 



Some fields I've considered (but know nothing or very little about)

* Gaming related

* IT related job

* Finance related 




Any extra schooling I go for would have to be a relatively short/fast tracked?  As I cannot afford to go back to school for 4 years.


Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated, 
for example, the IT field is huge, what sort of courses should I take?  How much money will I make?

Obviously i want to make the most money possible.  For reference I made ~75k at my previous job


Thank you in advance.





EDIT:   Thanks to everyone for all the replies.  I made this post less then 4 hours after getting let go, and did not expect so many replies.

My current plan is to take a couple days to digest everything, and do some research.

I will probably apply to some apprenticeship programs, while in the meantime try some introductory coding courses online to see how I like it.",1569474346.0,2019-09-26 01:05:46

I'm 26 (M) and I've been working as an analyst in a bank for 1 and a half years. It's a stressful job, we take a lot of shit from different people. The internal policies are ridiculous, they treat us like children, the work is incredibly tedious and repetitive, and honestly there doesn't seem to be much room for growth (the higher up jobs look unbearable). 

We have about two managers per analyst... And all that the managers do is discuss projects that never happen, fight over the holiday schedule, or convince us that we don't need to get paid for overtime.

I want out, I want to change industries all together. I have about 3 months savings at the moment and I was thinking of sucking it up for a few months while I applied to schools and saved some more.

But I have an anxiety disorder which stems from PTSD. I've kept my anxiety and depression on the down low at work, even though I know that my job enhances my symptoms. I've been muscling through, sometimes it gets really hard and I hide in the bathroom.

Today, while I was chatting with my manager, I suddenly felt like I couldn't breathe. Then I felt like I was going to die. I couldn't stand straight. Suddenly there was an ambulance and I was taken to the hospital. They had me there for three hours or so... At the end I just started crying.

Right now I'm at home trying to process what just happened. I'm terrified of going back to work tomorrow. I'm terrified that this might happen again. I don't want to go back. Is this a good time to jump off? Can I say I need to take this time to focus on my mental health and have a look at other options?

I have a couple of months of rent saved up , will be starting school next week (video editing and production) at a local community college (very low cost) and already have a part time job lined up at a local restaurant.

However, as happy as I am to be pursuing something I’ve always wanted to do and chase after my dreams. The “logical” side of my brain which chooses the money is going nuts. Mind you, there is no way I will go back to Logistics, I’ve grown to hate the job and the repetitiveness of it. I worked at one of the best logistics companies in the world with great benefits an awesome team and good pay. None of this was enough as I simply no longer had any interest in it. I was basically dragging myself out of bed every morning and had become anxiety ridden and depressed feeling as if I was just slowly rotting in my cubicle.

I am actually excited for the restaurant job even though it will only pay a fraction of my old job because its something different . But I know I want to make more money than I did before. Not to mention, I will need a steady income to buy equipment and build my media company as I grow my skills.

Again, lots of people have asked why I didnt stay at my old job amd went to school at the same time. With 55+ hours of work a week and my hate towards the job it was just not possible. I wanted out . So going back to that is simply not an option . If rather struggle with part times until I find something else than go back to it.

With that said. I am 31 now and have been working since age 17. Ive been a delivery driver, warehouse supervisor, got a BA in Psychology, have some experience in sales and worked as a logistics coordinator for the last 7 years.

Nonetheless, right now I dont have kids a mortgage or any debt. But my savings aren’t huge either just enough to get by for about 4-5 months plus whatever I make on the part time.

Ive looked into e-commerce and drop-shipping since I have extensive experience with imports from Asia and Europe due to my work in logistics. However, that industry really seems like a gamble and I dont have money to spare/throw away in hopes of getting lucky.

I do speak spanish fluently and have no trouble befriended and talking to people so there’s that as well.

Ever since I can remember I've been a super curious, knowledge-seeking person which I think helped me alot in certain aspects of my life but it makes deciding which courses to take in college and what my career path will look like a nightmare...

For some background, I just turned 20 (today's my birthday!) and I'm currently in my second year of a bachelor's in Computer Science. I chose Computer Science mainly because it would allow me to get a job pretty much anywhere in the world but I don't particularly LOVE it. I'm quite interested in Psychology, Neuroscience, History,  Philosophy but also some Politics and some aspects of engineering. I'm not super extroverted but I'm also not an introvert, I like to be around people and sometimes even talk in public to a lot of people but other times I just wanna be alone for a whole weekend.

I feel like people can rely on me and I would do well on a managerial position but I'm unsure since I don't have any job experience.  I love learning about diferent cultures and how they go about their day, including traditions, ideas, how they view the world etc, so having a job that somehow included that would be amazing (although maybe hard to obtain).

Anyone that has gone through a similar situation? I have never really asked for help before because I always ended up deciding and living with the consequences but this time I want to get it right (or as close as possible anyway).

I’m now in a position where I’m considering a complete shift to be able to actually allow myself to be present for parts of my life that aren’t work.

Just want to know if anyone else feels the same and has taken the steps towards the change?

My background and story which you can skip if you want:

I started law as an admin assistant because I needed money and stability, now I’m a paralegal/trainee fee earner; and somehow found myself in a position that they’re paying for the majority of my qualification and have been absolutely amazing about giving me a career. But while I enjoy law and I think I could do well, I don’t know if that’s I want that life for myself. I’ve seen what the stress and pressure has done to my colleagues moving up from support to fee earner. 

I’ve been fully geared towards becoming a commercial property lawyer for about 3 years now, but I’ve been moved to a different department which isn’t what I love at all but I’ll have my own files and be earning more money quicker; but I’m miserable (to the point I’m on medication and therapy at my doctors request) and I don’t know if I’ll be able to manage being a fee earner and doing my qualification at the same time. 

I’ve already decided to ask to step back to assistant/secretarial role while I get my qualification; but I’ve been offered an opportunity of a lifetime doing a job I wanted to do since I was 16 and went to college for, but life didn’t work out at that time starting as an apprentice and working up . But now I would be coming into the new career making more or the same as what I’m making now after a couple months of intense work, instead of years. 

The opportunity I’ve been offered is the polar opposite of my current career (law going to art) and I had given up on pursuing what I wanted because stability and affording a mortgage was more important. It’s also a career that my husband works in so I know the stress and downsides so I don’t think I’m considering this with heart shaped glasses. And I have the option to carry on my qualification and good contacts if I decide to come back, while I work in the new career.

I do enjoy law! But now I have this opportunity for a completely different career. It terrifies me, I want to peruse something that will make me happy, but the lack of security and shift in career and comfortably makes me feel sick. 

But after this year, I’m realising it’s important to take those opportunities and go for what you think will work best for you, put your time into something where it makes you feel good.",1608013810.0,2020-12-15 01:30:10

And preferably not require 8 hours a day, or 40 hours a week, but I wouldn’t be unwilling to spend that much time since the benefit would be getting to be at home by myself.

Disclaimer, I’m 24, but a social anomaly, and my family’s abuse and being financially unable to support myself makes me socially withdrawal even more.

I’m kind of relieved school has been moved online (because of the pandemic that mentioning gets people banned and demonetized in the case of YouTubers) because socially, I was getting nowhere.

I’m a college freshman at 24 years old, who sucks at driving (recently failed the test) and completely dependent on my parents to not be homeless. 

I couldn’t even get the pills I require to function on a basic level if it weren’t for being on my parent’s health insurance (I live in the United States, no Universal Healthcare here), which I will be legally forced off when I turn 26. If I lost access I could literally end up another crazy homeless person, and no offense to anyone (I know some really are just down on their luck) but I would rather kill myself than be homeless (also because I’ve already been abused and miserable my whole life)

I suffer from OCD, ADD, and more recently, severe anxiety, depression, and until my psychiatrist added another medication, near-violent rage (I can’t function at all without medication, and I’m still not a functional adult).

I hate my job, but I am very grateful to have it (especially throughout the whole pandemic, because many people have lost their jobs) and virtually always go in, no matter how bad I feel, because I know that being unemployed is 100x worse.

I literally just bag groceries, get grocery carts from a parking lot, and restock returned items. Sad part is, I started in a regular department, where I was even initially told that I was doing good, then that quickly turned into me being “too slow” and “missing too many details”.

I do not want any handouts, even if I am legally entitled, I’m already ashamed enough, and relying on others to survive is a TERRIBLE feeling, the fact that I rely on my own parents makes it somewhat more bearable, but I still get let know that I’m “past my time”, sure, I contribute to some things, but that’s such a small percentage of full living costs, my parents work very hard (I know life is hard, one of my biggest mistakes was growing up believing life was easy and just happened by itself).

I had internet friends, but withdrew myself because it felt pointless talking to people I’d never see. I also swore off LDRs, because I’d never get to see any of those girls/women in real life, even if I could, I can’t afford actual living costs, and even if she’s one of those women who takes care of her man (nothing wrong with that if it’s ok for a man to take care of a woman) I don’t want my livelihood dependent on anybody but myself.

If I have a girlfriend and we break up, I at least shouldn’t have to worry about being broke or homeless.

I’m willing to work, but it eats me up inside everyday, doing a job that nobody actually needs done (or at least takes virtually no skill to do whatsoever), having people treating me like I’m slow (stop calling me buddy unless you’re Canadian!) automatically seeing my job position, and feeling unworthy of any social interaction, if I befriended anyone, it wouldn’t be long before the questions start about my lifestyle, and I will be judged, negatively.

I have too many mental issues, emotional, even physical (some may or may not be caused from medication), and now I’m plagued with insecurity, and despite desperately wanting to break dependence on my family, lack of motivation to do anything.

OK, I do have motivation and interests, they’re just not very strong or consistent, nothing is really THAT INTERESTING, if it is, the interest won’t last long, until it’s just another memory that’s no longer associated with pleasure.

Other reasons working from home would be nice, more dependent on myself (well, if I’m self-employed, which would be true financial freedom, or at least as close to possible as it), less forced socializing means more energy, less anxiety (I’ve literally resisted a panic attack to run out of the building, although that was the first day of a job, and it was better as soon as the second day, although it was seasonal and they let me go after the season), and hell, this whole pandemic is reason enough to work from home if possible. 

I was never meant to be a social extrovert, if I can have any social and/or dating life, I don’t want it to be too much. 

It’s hard to feel any worth or value from doing work that you don’t feel purpose from, especially when you have nothing else, or nobody else, to live for outside of a job. 

Even if I don’t have to be a complete social hermit (I’ve come so close to becoming a complete misanthropist due to how I’m treated, and resisted falling into the cult of inceldom and misogyny, when I manage to avoid hatred, my perspective just leaves me with confusion) it’d still be nice to be able to work from home, and make not driving even easier (that’s caused so many issues for me, and I’ve spent so much on Uber and now risking catch the you know what, and some mentally unstable guy almost drove into incoming traffic with me as a rider!)

*Sigh*

Even when I’m told how much I’m appreciated and how good a job I do, I feel like worthless garbage, because that’s not a real accomplishment for somebody my age, I should have a REAL ADULT JOB and be living on my own, supporting myself.

I’m not worried about supporting a family (why the hell would I want to create kids against their will who could suffer just like I have? That’s assuming any woman even wanted to do that with me) but feel I need to make a lot of money just for myself, for freedom, because true freedom only exists with a lot of money. I’ve never felt free, yet my family claims that “Democrat socialists” will take our freedom away, especially because “socialism is the first step leading to communism”. 

Well ONE, I think America needs a better social safety net and PROGRESSION (we should strive to be like Denmark, the happiest nation on Earth, me may have a much bigger country, but we also have more wealth to cover it) and TWO, I’ve never felt freedom anyway.

The closest I ever got to freedom almost left me homeless, that hurt my sense of competence even more. Being told I’m stupid for trying doesn’t feel like freedom, and being stranded from running out of savings certainly doesn’t feel like freedom.

I was told to try and change my situation if I was so miserable, and when I tried just that, my family told me how wrong it was and that I needed to go back to sitting at home, and I ran out of savings from motel rooms and applying to basic jobs, ending up staying with other family and relying on government assistance just to eat!

I've been working since I was 16 and have had quite a few different jobs since then ranging from a couple months to 3-4 years.

I recently started a job that is actually gonna set me up pretty comfortably for the future but I just cannot get used to the idea that I will be working the rest of my life. I have felt this way through all my jobs and family and friends say to suck it up this is how life gets but I just can't accept it.

I spend my whole days working and use my weekend to do nothing productive then feel bad on sundays when I have to go back to work on monday. The problem is when I dont do anything on the weekend i just usually game out and not really do anything. But even when I have weekend plans and spend the weekend away from home I don't feel relaxed. In fact I haven't found anything to occupy my times on weekends that makes me feel okay with going back to work.

I then get into this cycle of where I just can't stand it anymore and quit my job because of all the pressure.

All I can think of when im at work is coming home to game or hang out with people and then when my weekend comes all I can think about is all the million things I want to do and would rather do than go to work next week.


I have tried to use my own time to do things I am interested in but my job is quite physical and I spend most my time recovering on weekends and after work when my hobbies include exercising or being active.

90 percent of the jobs I have worked have all been physical jobs and I really don't want this to be the rest of my life. I have no real college or university experience I don't know what to do really.

I have tried talking to Councillors and work on bettering myself but after a few months I always feel the same way I do now and I really wish I could feel better about life. 

Sorry if this seems like a jumbled mess, just trying to work this off my chest.

629,Can't get any kind of job. What happens to people like me?,137,fo246f,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fo246f/cant_get_any_kind_of_job_what_happens_to_people/,81,"I'm in my early-mid twenties and I've never had a job.

Without getting into too much detail, I've had a problem throughout my entire life which had disallowed me from participating effectively in any kind of institutional setting. I would summarize the problem by saying that I can't deal with ambiguity. In school, I would sometimes not turn in work that I had already done because I wasn't exactly sure where or how to turn it in, and I was too afraid to ask. That's an extreme case, but I had lots of other smaller issues like that. Not sure of how to do some kind of project that they provided little to no information on the specifics of. I'm sure people can relate, but the difference between you and me is that you seem to be able to bs your way through it and find some way to figure out what they're trying to ask you to do.

I was homeschooled for a lot of my life, and my problems with ambiguous instructions began in 4th grade where I attended a public school for the first time. I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I generally lack common sense in a lot of areas, leading to various other problems functioning. I would go into more detail but it seems unnecessary for now. The basic point I'm trying to make is that I can't deal with normal institutional scenarios. I'm pretty intelligent and pretty talented in some areas, but when an obligation presents itself in the form of an institution, that's when I can't deal with it. I don't want to deal with it but I also can't. Somehow, when a bunch of bureaucrats or a bunch of profiteers get involved in some sort of activity, they turn the activity itself into a secondary goal. The main goal is to fulfill the bureaucracy's requirements, or to suck up to the right people, or to help your boss make profit. No one wants me to do some task for the sake of simply doing the task, and I think the spirit of that situation is just very difficult for me to function in, and the ambiguous instructions that come up in that situation are just the cherry on top, guaranteeng that I won't be able to do what the job is asking. As an example, I'm somewhat talented at computer security, and I enjoy messing around on my own with it, but in an employment scenario, instead of just doing what needs to be done, I'm suddenly gonna have to write a report, and present a slideshow, or some other bureaucratic garbage which as I said, is designed to fulfill some need other than the immediate requirements of the job, which is where I struggle.

So anyway, just to finish my history. I went to middle school until I left in the 7th grade when I dropped out and became homeschooled again, which didn't actually entail much official schooling. I mostly just educated myself on stuff I happened to be interested in. My parents knew I couldn't take public school anymore. I went to a community college during the time that I was finishing up my homeschooling time. It took me over five years but eventually I got a associates degree and in college I suffered from all the same problems I laid out before. But I did get the degree. It's useless for me however.

So, I'm now in a situation where I've kind of accepted that I can't get a job. If I were to go to an interview, I'd be far too awkward and unable to follow the instructions during the interview, both in preparation for it and in terms of answering the questions during it. Secondly, if I did ever get a job somehow, I'd be fired within a couple weeks as soon as the employers see that I can't perform. My parents have been understanding to some degree and have supported me up until now, but our financial situation is much tighter now and I really want to try and help out, even though I know I can't.

I would say that the only job I could really get would be some kind of job where the boss tells you exactly what to do and there's no reading between the lines whatsoever. For example, the boss says ""take this shovel and move these rocks from this pile into that pile."" I can do that, but even with manual labor, a lot of it is too difficult for me to interpret what they're asking me to do. Does anyone have any advice on what I should try to do? I basically just want some kind of manual labor job (not dissing manual labor at all here, just to be clear) where I don't really have to engage in deep thought about what's going on. I was thinking maybe some kind of assembly line job could be possible. I really want to try and find something here, but I don't really think there's a specific job that allows for simple manual labor like that. Do such jobs exist, and if so, what sort of titles would they be under and how might I apply for it? I I just wonder what happens to people like me sometimes. I mean what if I can't get any kind of job? I live in the US and we have basically no welfare state whatsoever. Especially since I've never had a job, they won't give me anything. I guess I'm just gonna be homeless, but I think I might have missed some kind of opportunity in the form of a simple, manual labor job that doesn't require previous experience in carpentry or construction or anything like that, and that doesn't require any of the thinking on your feet that I'm so bad at.

I’ve been at this company for about 2.5 years, but my heart has never been in it. I took the job for the money. I moved from client-side back to consulting.


Though I’ve been looking for a new role elsewhere since I started the job, (and gotten a few offers over this duration), I liked my coworkers and wanted to give it an honest try.  TBH, it wasn’t going so badly. 


Then at the start of 2019, there was a leadership change both at CEO level, and Regional Director (RD) for my geography.  It’s been a massive cultural shift, especially in our region where the new RD was brought in from a competitor with a very different business approach.  It’s a very poor cultural alignment. 


Now there is lots of alienation among the existing leadership cohort as new RD brings in his team from his past company. Of course these new joiners all have a similar cultural approach.  It’s getting pretty toxic all around as several of us know we are being setup to exit the business. 


I’m not immune.  My role is being redefined under this new regime. RD no longer wants me in a region-wide team leadership and oversight role, he just wants me to focus on my city, hands on with projects. It’s great that I won’t have to travel so much, but it feels like a demotion, not the next step to long term success.


HQ (on another continent) loves my work so far and has offered me additional equity in the company. I have great support back there and my overall salary situation is fantastic. As the new RD seems to be pushing me out the door, the award of equity feels like a mind-f**k.


I’m eager to move on, but golden handcuffs are tough to shake off.  I need to do the best I can where I am at until I find another landing spot. 


So what to say in the goal setting?  I’m totally unengaged, disinterested, and resentful. 


I know playing it too candidly isn’t the right thing, even though my line manager is equally disaffected by the organisational transformation that surrounds us. 


Any suggestions on how to do this dance would be appreciated. My emotions are getting in the way and clouding my judgement.",1562502801.0,2019-07-07 08:33:21

I  work in a digital agency for a little more than three years. In the last year, before became de leader of my team, I've been the employee  who worked a shift of 12 hours long, but I loved of what I was doing,  taking care of 12 clients and my job was mostly hands on, without so  many meetings. Recently I became the coordinator of my team, so I have  to take care of 7 people, plus over 50 clients. And since the beginning  of the year all I'm doing now is doing meetings with current and new  clients, leaving my team aside. I feel responsible for a lot of mistakes  they've been doing, since I can't take a closer look at them because of  all these meetings. Sometimes these meetings start at 9 a.m. and end 9  p.m., one after another, lunch in front of the PC was really common (or  not eating at all). Besides that, I've been disliking the way the  company is being managed, since a new COO is in charge.

My  worst breakdown came when I was talking with my new employee, showing  to him a few things about the company, and seeing the messages in my  whastapp, skype and e-mail coming up all at once, feeling really  overwhelmed. When I finished speaking with this new employee, I called  to a fried of mine and started to cry a lot.

Besides  all that the corona virus situation makes me feel bad too. I've been  fearful that I contract this and let my parents sick too (both 70+). So  I'm really concerned with them, while them don't believe in anything of  what's happening.

For the past 30 days I'm having a breakdown, so working is being really difficult. For these past days I'm feeling:

* restless
* heavy chest
* couldn't sleep (or sleeping really late so I could enjoy more time away from work)
* I woke a lot of times feeling down and wanting to cry
* crying really, really easily
* questioning about my work and myself
* isolating myself
* easily forgetting any information
* walking up and down in my house with a blank mind, feeling anxious

I  asked for a vacation so I could rest a little, hoping that I could feel  better. I even disabled any notifications from my whatsapp so I could rest and don't think about them. But I'm in the last day of my vacation and can’t see an end to feeling this way. I've been thinking about changing careers too, so I don't have to speak with clients.

I  tried to speak with the CEO and the COO about that, but all they did  was opening an excel table, write down a few solutions (none of them was good) and asking for me for a solution. There was no empathy to my feelings.

I don't know what this feeling is (burnout maybe?) and I don't know what to do. Should I quit my job and rest for a while? Should I change my career to another one that I don't need to talk with clients? Is there any other way to handle this?

Recently I started getting a psychological support, but still this feeling doesn't go away.

Ps: Sorry for my English, it's not my first language.

TL;DR:  I'm really introspective and I think because of my job as a team coordinator, having to talk to a lot of clients, going through a lot of  stressful situations (like averting cancellations), it's making me feel really down about my work and myself lately, and I don't know what to do or how make this feeling go away.",1592249735.0,2020-06-15 15:35:35

I'm 32 (M) and have been working for 4 years now. The first 3 years of my career I worked abroad. Just over a year ago I moved back home. I'm currently at my 5th employer after changing jobs a few time because of moving between cities but also because of a few very bad experiences where I didn't like/hated my job. I've worked at a wide variety of companies as a data analyst/market researcher, from scale-ups to some of the world's largest advisory firms. The pay has always been very good. Currently, I'm working at a bank.

Everywhere around me I see people being super engaged with the company/job. They appear to be what some call ""passionate"". The problem is that I've never been satisfied (or passionate) with any of the jobs I had. The first few months I'm super excited getting to know the company, the people, and learn the ropes. However, after a few months that feeling fades and I start to think about what to do next. 

This has resulted in things like casually looking on LinkedIn for jobs, getting hooked on the idea of starting my own business from home (e.g., dropshipping, starting a blog, and much more have passed) but never really going for it, focusing on hobbies hoping to make a living out of it and working om my technical skills (actually useful for my career).

It's not that I hate my job or that I wake up every day dreading going to work; it just not fulfills me to the same extent as it does for the ""passionate"" people. Maybe I get bored very easily, maybe I'm not in the right field of work, maybe I've just had bad luck with jobs, maybe I should change my mindset. I don't know!

It was 3:30 and these were due at EOB. I quickly started on these documents and realized today that on the Excel document I over looked the instructions tab and other tab I had to fill out.

My old manager gave me this feedback at my previous job and I am afraid I am not improving. I can't help but feel like I have tunnel vision.

Any ideas on how to combat this?

I do not have a nest egg as I have to take care of my 84 year old mom that lives with me. So I can not quit until I have another job.

648,"35 y/o, $500K~ net worth, Senior Manager in tech... but no degree and having a hard time advancing further. Is an online BA + MBA worth it at my age, or should I invest in other ways?",132,cd6hno,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/cd6hno/35_yo_500k_net_worth_senior_manager_in_tech_but/,75,"**TL:DR is in the title.**

35 years old, attended college for 5-6 years but never finished a degree. About 15-20 hours away, but haven't enrolled anywhere since 2008-09.

Ran a small business for a while, had other jobs, then in 2011 got into a niche online streaming industry very early and had success. Eventually became a founding member (but not an owner) of a start-up company in Silicon Valley that was later acquired by a subsidiary of one of the largest companies in the world. That happened four years.

Since that time, have worked my way up internally to Senior Manager ($160-170K), was on track for Director by end of this year ($200-220K), but unfortunately a new boss was hired from the East Coast and he and I are no simpatico. No demotion, but was involuntarily reassigned to a smaller role, managing 20% of the people I used to, all remote. It's time to go.

Due to my background and experience in what it still a relatively niche part of the industry, expected to be able to make a non-lateral move relatively easily. Was very wrong. No callbacks at all for Director+ level positions, only Senior Manager level positions. Have gone deep into the process in a few, but no offer yet but expecting one next week... but it'll be for a Senior Manager position with only a modest (10-20% pay increase). Have become convinced this is the result of a lack of a degree, especially an MBA, which those who were eventually hired into the best positions I sought had in common.

Currently engaged to be married next year and living together, household income of around $260K in the Bay Area, around $400K in stock and $100K in other investments tucked away. We're comfortable and stable.

Here's the question: At my age, does it make sense to sell about $150K in stock for me to complete an online degree at my former university (they offer Reagent Bachelor of Arts degrees (RBA) specifically for people in my situation) and then enroll at a top 10 online MBA school (most likely USC)? Or would I be better off letting that money grow, using it to fund other FIRE oriented projects, etc? Are online MBA's worth it? Or am I misguided in believing they're the big difference maker in breaking through to Director+ level?

Long term goal is to bank away $2MM minimum, $4MM optimum to retire as early as possible. How I get there doesn't matter to me.

Do I stick with what I went to school for or chase my childhood dream?",133,c60c82,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c60c82/im_23_i_graduated_college_six_months_ago_and_im/,47,"I had my 23rd birthday this week, which was also almost six months to the day since I graduated from college with a degree in video production. In these past six months I have done essentially nothing with my life. It has been a constant mental battle trying to figure out just where exactly I fit in the real world. I'm torn between potential career paths and paralyzed with fear that I won't make the right choice.

While I certainly enjoyed my production classes and learning about the world of media in college it was never what I set out to learn at the start. I began my college career as an engineering student, but difficulties with my school's math classes forced me to change my major after my freshman year. I changed to the ""university studies"" major, which is a nice way of saying undecided, and floated around taking business, sociology, and media classes before the deadline for me to declare a major. I chose media production because it was what I enjoyed most of the areas I had studied, and because it reminded me of the fun I had doing the lighting for school plays in high school. But I honestly have no desire to spend the rest of my days editing news clips or sports highlights.

My true passion has always been cars. I've spent countless hours since I was young researching and learning about cars, and different ways to maintain and modify them. I always wanted to have a project car, and eventually become a mechanic but my parents wanted me to drive something safe and new, and to get a bachelors degree so I could get a ""real job."" Now I finally have a project car, but I'm too afraid to do anything with it because I've had the idea that I shouldn't waste my time and money on cars drilled into my brain by my family. They are also very white collar, and whenever I bring up the idea of becoming a mechanic again it is almost always dismissed for reasons such as ""you won't make enough money to support a family."" 

So what do I do? I need to start working soon at this point, because I want to start moving forward with other aspects of adult life like saving to move out of my mom's house, and dating (which I have not had much luck with since I'm unemployed and live with my mother obviously). I enjoy video production, but I'm not passionate about it like I am with cars. However, I actually have some background with videography whereas I have very little hands on automotive experience, and I would likely have to start out doing oil and tire changes for around $10/hour before I could move up to a full mechanic position. Either way I'd probably only make around $30-40k a year in the end whether I am a video editor or working as a mechanic at a dealership.",1561634452.0,2019-06-27 07:20:52

Here is my story:

&#x200B;

I always enjoyed being creative, and while I never planned to go I made a last minute decision to go to university to study BA Games Art, and graduated with a 2:2. I consider it to be an essentially useless qualification that isn't particularly useful, and something that I was never good enough at to seriously pursue anyway.

&#x200B;

After university I fell into a customer service call centre environment, then after nearly 3 years I joined a software company working in sales. I wasn't terrible at it, but the constant stress and pressure made me dread it everyday. Still, I stuck it out for nearly 3 years and found myself in a position where I could take a year off and travel, with the idea I'd do some soul searching and ""find myself"".

&#x200B;

Now I'm back, I've joined another smaller software company as an account manager, although there is no sales element here. As I sit here writing this, I'm kinda terrified that I still don't know what I'm doing. I can't really see much room for progression in this career path, except into more sales type roles, which I know I don't want to do. As I get older money is becoming more important to me as I find I can barely afford to rent let alone think about getting any assets of my own.

&#x200B;

I find myself looking at posts online about retraining, going back to university, starting again a whole new career - but I don't have the first idea about how to do that.

We know we are behind on retirement but came out of school with a combined 100k in student loan debt and have aggressively paid it down to around 40k now (she has BS and I have BS/MBA). Overall we make considerably more right now than we need and have been using that on the student loans. 

I’ve worked in construction management since getting out of school and have had ups and downs with that. I’m very good at it and enjoy building teams and systems, but in two different roles in the industry I’ve experienced the same issues with massive hour expectations and work/life balance struggles. For context, it’s not uncommon to work long weekdays then cap the week off with over 40 hours between Friday to Sunday. My wife and I have had some issues based on her frustration with me never being home and being exhausted to the point of uselessness when I am home. I can’t blame her at all. 

I’m very strongly considering switching to manufacturing and taking a 15-20k hit in salary as a result (in a maintenance management or planning role). I initially started looking for manufacturing roles that would be around the same salary, but most either want lots of industry experience or have major travel elements. This move would however bring my hours down a lot to close to 40, and most of the roles I’m pursuing have flexibility in the hours. She works 530-4 M-Th, and while I don’t expect to work 4 10s it’s looking like I could make my M-F schedule 6-3 or something similar to get home before/when she does. 

I’m leaning heavily towards taking the step, but what negatives am I not considering? I know that this move would delay the student loan payoffs and am completely prepared for that, but what else should I be thinking about? 

Most of my family I talk to tell me to stick it out until the loans are gone, but my big fear is looking back in 4 years at a zero student loan balance and either having lost my wife or realizing I’d wasted a full decade of my youth in an industry I don’t enjoy. ",1538689516.0,2018-10-04 17:45:16

I've always read and heard that you should never be honest in the exit interview, never give feedback, they don't deserve it, etc etc.

My question to the group is, is there ever situations where it may actually be of some benefit to the company you're leaving?

&#x200B;

I've got a potential job offer coming up. I've asked for a raise at my current company, citing numerous sources of data suggesting that it's a fair argument. The response is ""we don't have it in the budget this year, CEO wouldn't go for it, etc"". Other employees have told me that they have received the same response. But magically, when someone gets a job offer paying more, my current company matches it.

It's a situation where I enjoy my boss and the company. Just not their old school approach to compensation. Even if they matched my potential offer, I won't take it. I'm not mad at them and there's no ill will.

I'm confident that I could say this in an exit interview without burning bridges. We have a good enough relationship for that.

My thought is, is it such a bad thing that I call my current company on this? Yes, they may not change. But they sure as hell won't if no one says anything about it and just smiles and gives the ""It's just an opportunity I can't turn down"" answer. If I could potentially open the door for someone else to get a raise in result of me leaving, to me that's a win.

What say ye? Let's discuss.

I have been with this new company for about 2 months. 

I've witnessed my manager have a rage fit (akin to a temper tantrum) directed at my colleague over something my manager misunderstood. 

My manager is a hyper micromanager that has embarrassed me ""in front of"" (typically through email) individuals both in and outside of our company.

He has a tendency towards rude behavior such as cutting you off mid sentence once he's decided he doesn't have time to listen. Also for example... He has told me to ""be silent"" in conference calls, then when I quietly try to assist him with a misspoken word or a note he's searching for he throws his hand up in the air to mime ""Silence!!"". 

The issue I have currently that I need help with is:
We have a project kick off meeting to attend 4 hours from our office. Long story short, he has told me that I am going no matter what. If I drive my car, I will be driving him back from the meeting, he will be taking a train to get to the meeting. 

He did not ask if I would give him a ride. He told me. He's done this once before regarding an hour-long drive to a meeting. (He asked: Are you driving to the meeting or taking a train? I told him: I'm going to drive. He said: Okay, then I'm going with you.) The meeting was first thing in the morning, I'd have to drive to pick him up then drive to the meeting.  Incidentally this didn't happen, because I was pulled to cover other work.

I am physically sick with anxiety, despite some honest efforts to accept it and process it. I'm even detailing my car this weekend, as I think that will set me slightly more at ease.

 In part I know it will be ""fine"", I don't believe he'll treat me poorly in the car. I am incredibly uncomfortable though, his behavior is inappropriate at best. I am also a young woman and uncomfortable with his apparent subconscious need to intimidate me and my female colleague.

Does anyone have any advice? Tips on how to get out of this? Anything that will set me at ease, and ease my nausea?

From  my knowledge of the company, we are making similar money as we did last  year. My 3 year mark was 2 months ago with not a hint of a raise or cost of living adjustment. My pay is the same as it was 2 year ago so  far this year. No bonuses given so far this year.

Base  pay is 44k for a Marketing, IT & Website management role in the  company(multiple hats).

No 401k either. I was told offering healthcare was too expensive for a small business so a credit is offered instead.

In the 3 years I have been here my tiny credit is worth even less towards a plan. Most family plans are now 850-1400 a month that cover anything. $125 is a drop in the bucket.

We have around 20 employees most of the time. I make most things work  around here along with managing several websites(and building them). I  also have the official title of Marketing Manager and do marketing tasks but its not the main role even though I have the title. I report directly to  the owner and a direct supervisor above me. I am also the companies Photographer/Video guy with our own studio. 

At this point in my life(30 years old) I really want more paid leave, some actual sick time and more pay to raise a family on. A larger healthcare credit or actual healthcare would be nice.

665,Should you apply for a job even if you don't have *every* qualification?,127,95m7ga,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/95m7ga/should_you_apply_for_a_job_even_if_you_dont_have/,50,"I did a lot of hiring and firing in one of my previous jobs, and one thing that we'd do on our job requisitions is list a bunch of technologies that people ""should know"". But, that didn't mean that the candidate needed to know \*every\* technology. We sorta meant it more along the lines of ""some"" to ""most"", but definitely not none.   


Here's my attempt at providing some career guidance this week: Don't let job requisitions scare you if they list stuff that you may not have any direct experience with. That said, definitely be honest with yourself. Don't apply for a position that you know that you aren't qualified for. You're wasting your time as well as the time of our interviewers. But, do not let a long list of requirements necessarily dissuade you from applying for a position that you honestly believe you could add value to.   


The worst that happens is you don't get the position. But, you also get practice tailoring your resume to the job opportunity (yes, tailoring your resume is important) and, if you're called into an interview, you also get to practice your interviewing skills - something that I've found a LOT of people need a LOT of help with.   


tl;dr career advice: Apply for any position that you honestly feel qualified for and don't get scared off if you don't meet every one of the requirements.",1533765356.0,2018-08-08 17:55:56

I’ve been really depressed after graduating from UC San Diego last June 2019. It’s been months and months of constant rejection. I’ve only get offered jobs from minimum wage jobs such as Target. I graduated with a bachelors in science in public health. I’m starting to realize my degree gets me no where. However, a few of my peers with the same degree has found a job related to health. I also have been applying to internships, yet I never get called to set up an interview. I have previous work experience at an office and I have plenty of volunteer experience. None of these has led me to any job entry positions. Am I doing something wrong? Is it my Resume? The way I type information onto online applications. My lack of skills? My degree? I’m just deeply depressed and I even moved back home in Northern California with my parents and they’re financially supporting me. This makes me feel completely guilty as I’m the first to graduate and I can’t get a job anywhere. Not even the public health department at different state counties will offer me an interview.

I’ve been super down and all of that sadness comes from moving back home with my parents, not having any friends at my hometown, and no money.

He started verbally listing all the things I was doing wrong, the stupidest one being that I always played with my hair while working.

He said that he had written a list of things I needed to improve on. When I asked for the list, he refused and said that I needed to fix everything on my own.

Finally when he did provide me actual training, he brought in someone that worked from home due to chronic illness and fatigue. After each meeting when this employee was gone, my boss would pull me aside and berate me again for taking advantage of a sick employee.

I guess there's something convenient about asking total strangers who don't know you. I really don't know who else to ask about this, but it's been bugging me for a while now.

I've been feeling a lack of motivation at work for months now. I'm not too sure of the reason, but I think I know part of it. Which is, my skill level is way higher than most of my teammates. I always help them, but it's not my job to be educating them about everything, this is stuff they should've learned from their experience. Instead, I find myself constantly having to help people with their tasks, on a near daily basis. This is draining me. I feel like maybe this gap in the skill set is playing a major role in my lack of motivation, since if I'm being honest, I constantly feel like I'm being dragged down. My own progression at work has been really slow for a while.

I really don't know what I should do. Is it simply time to leave the job? Should I just tell my boss that the team needs some professional training? But then again, I don't want my team to think I think they suck. I don't think they do, I just honestly think that their skill level should be higher considering the amount of experience they have. I personally have about the same amount of experience as they do, so I can't find an explanation for the skill gap. Another possibility I'm dreading is that this could be a sign of depression. Could that also be a possibility or does it sound just absurd?

I'd really appreciate any help or advice. Please don't misunderstand my post. I'm not complaining about my teammates, I'm just honestly trying to figure out the source of my lack of motivation and how best to tackle it.

EDIT: Just to reiterate in case this goes the wrong, I don't think my team are bad at their job (even though I truly think some of them could be better), I just think that maybe I also might have worked on my skills a bit too much. Ok I'll say it, there's no other way to put it, I do think I'm good at my job. Not amazingly great, but still good (I did put a great deal of effort though).

I spent the last year driving for uber and I found that it was good soul searching experience.  I found out 2 things about myself.    


1.  I love motivating and inspiring others.  The best times I had as a driver were when I was able to motivate an inspire younger underprivlages high school kids.  Weather that's talking about college, or encouraging them to deliver pizza instead of dope.  It really made me feel good and  I was good at it.    


2. Theres nothing like working for yourself.  I ended up putting a lot more hours into work because I was not working for anyone else.    


So my masters degree is in health science.  I wish I could get into a counciling or therapist role with that, but I can not.  Also, I do not have an undergrad degree.. I went to grad school in my jr. year.  Also.. my masters is from a Caribbean school.  So far nobody has given me any grief about where it is from, but I do think I will run into problems applying for masters programs here in the US. 

I would love to be a psychologist.. but I feel like I might be too late.  Im really good at fixing things, I have really good clinical knowledge and knowledge of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology and other medicine related subjects.  I have good computer skills, good leadership skills, good customer service skills, good math skills and can be extremely hard working.  


I live in Seattle right now and while on unemployment I have been spending my time teaching myself SQL.  Its slow going, and I don't even know if I can get a job afterwards.  The other Idea I have is to use my uber income and save up and get a food truck.  Seattle has a big hole for late night food.  hope u have a good day, thanks.",1590415903.0,2020-05-25 10:11:43

Is this normal practice? I can certainly see/feel the economic value of undercutting

Recruiter invited me to a invite only job fair. When I arrived the HR rep automatically assumed I was there for a ""shift supervisor position"" which is way lesser of a position than I was going for/ qualified for. She said there was only shift supervisor & assistant management positions open. I told her I must have been mislead, and I had spoken to a recruiter on linked in. Only then did she ""check her computer"" & see that in fact, there was a full management position open. 

The interview itself was with the general manager, & I completely nailed the interview. This company focuses on guest service and standards so I answered my questions around that. My district manager from my previous job used to be this managers district manager as well, so I made sure to ask if she knew him in the interview. They did seem worried that I had worked only low volume locations(my companies high volume doesn't touch their low volume), but loved that I had experience as a leader in 3 stores, supporting other locations & had opened a brand new location in the area recently as well. I also had all the management training done, certifications done, & experience training leaders/tms for the district.  I almost expected to be hired on the spot. But was told they needed to get through the rest of the applicants, see how the day plays out & then would get back to me. 

The recruiter reached out to me and asked what I thought. I was completely honest, I told him about the mix up & how the hr rep seemed to judge me based on my age. He said he would figure out what happened because he had spoken prior directly with her & said that I specifically was there for the upper level management position. He basically hinted that I was overqualified. 

The manager reached out to me and asked me to come in for a second interview with another manager. The interview was with both managers. It was extremely laid back and it seemed like more of a meet & greet then an interview. When I explained all the training I had, the second manager asked the first what one of them was- and the first goes ""thats the training you're doing now."" The second manager asked the first if we talked about pay, where the first manager kinda of whispered - well I think that *hr rep* will discuss that. 

2 weeks went by and I thought ok, not happening. Then I get a call from the hr rep apologizing because they realized noone had reached out and then offering me the position. I explained I was still interested but was currently at work & asked if I could call back in a few hours. "" Ok no problem! ""
2 minutes later the 2nd manager calls me and asks if I'm still interested, I told her I just spoke to Jessica & I was, but I was at work and would call back in a few hours. I called back and neither answered their phones, kept ringing. I left a voicemail on one. Noone ever called me back but HR rep emailed me the welcome packet, job offer, etc. The position was for assistant manager (a position lower than I had interviewing for) but salary pay & higher than I was making at the job I was working. I completed all the paperwork (e-sign) sent it in, and asked if It was possible for a later start date so I could remain professional with my employer & give them correct notice. Hr rep replied it was no problem and since I let them know about my vacation during interviewing. She offered I start the day I come back. I said that would be great!

Since noone had called me back to discuss more of the position, I reached out to check about dress code. They said they would order me a shirt & asked what size. I replied back with size & a thank you. Now time has gone by and I am meant to start in 6 days. I reached out the day before my vacation to the 1st manager, Ccd the 2nd manager in, & did not get any responses.... I asked about the rest of the dress code, and where exactly/what time I would be reporting to since there are 3 locations on campus. 

3 days have passed since I sent the email. I'm on vacation at the other end of the country & would rather not make a phone call because the manager speaks very broken English and it's hard for me to find somewhere quiet here.

Hi Reddit!   


I am in my third week of my first permanent job post-college, and I've realized that this job might not be for me. During the interview process, I was told that my job would entail significant daily human interaction and interpersonal cooperation, which I personally need to be happy and productive. My first two weeks, however, have generally consisted of over seven-and-a-half plus hours of uninterrupted time in front of a computer screen and a few short minutes of small-talk with coworkers -  a schedule that has me quickly becoming depressed in my cubicle. Almost all of my limited work with others has been done via email. Before my hiring, they mentioned to me that there may be ""the occasional day of 8 hour screen time,"" but that it would be the exception.  


I'm seriously considering quitting, as I was just assigned a several-month long project that is not likely to change my work situation. I'm at a loss, because I never envisioned myself in a situation like this, and especially not after so short a time. I don't ever plan on being a job-hopper.  


My biggest concern with moving on is that I fear wasting the resources of the organization that hired me, and I also don't want the HR Manager and my boss to get in trouble for bringing me in and then me leaving so soon, since they were both responsible for hiring someone who would be able to come in and do important things immediately. They are both wonderful people who I don't want to put in a bad situation by leaving.   


That said, this schedule and job are killing me thus far, and I don't see myself staying long-term anyways.   


Any advice is appreciated.

Any advice or insight?,125,dl1tf7,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dl1tf7/thinking_of_quitting_dream_job_because_of_toxic/,53,"**TLDR: I had a successful event recently, but no good feedback from any of my toxic management. Management only talks to me when I've done something wrong and I'm reaching my last straw.  I originally wanted a raise, but now I'm thinking of leaving my dream job at this toxic workplace. What would you do?**

Hi everyone,

I'm a woman working in a toxic, male-dominated industry at an American company in Japan. Cool, famous company with big name-recognition; awful awful working environment.

To give an example of what I'm working with, the territory manager is a cold Japanese guy (let's call him Tanaka) who feeds on negative energy and my direct lead is a misogynist narcissistic American (let's call him Jimbo) who has really adapted to the Japanese culture of not being PC at all. He also has an awful temper, talks negatively about everything and everyone and will straight up ignore you if you're below him and he's mad at you or if he's wanting to feel important.

Jimbo's made jokes about cheating on his girlfriend, he's made multiple people in the office cry with his outbursts, he's belittled my ideas and then taken them to HQ without me in the discussion. When I asked him about why he did that, he gaslit me and said I remembered it wrong. He's done so much more, but I will leave it at that for now. Tanaka feeds off of Jimbo's energy and has given a lot of clout to Jimbo for his seniority and knowledge.

Until now, I've been trying to get through and biting my tongue because it's a dream job at a dream company with great benefits. I'm also trying to make it 6 more months before leaving so it doesn't look bad on my resume. However, a recent incident has my blood boiling, and I think I'm at my last straw.

I have been in charge of an event that takes six months of prep. This is the first time I've been fully in charge. We had record-breaking numbers and turnout for the event. Another team was involved in getting speakers for the event.

I was giving updates to Tanaka about the numbers, especially when we passed landmarks. I was expecting a pat on the back or something (he did that for the last person who was completely in charge) but I only got silence from him. I was a bit annoyed at this because he's quick to give negative feedback, so I was hoping for him to finally say something nice...

At the afterparty of the event, Jimbo pulls me aside and says, ""Good job on this event BUT you need to be giving more credit to people. The admin manager (gossipy JP woman) told me you've been taking all the credit"". I was shocked and hurt by this because I had never said this success was only because of myself. I was also increasingly annoyed because Jimbo frequently calls himself the ""One-man team"".

I didn't want to think the team thought I was taking all the credit so I immediately tried to rectify this by thanking everybody for their hard work. I said I couldn't do the event alone, and I also got some nice sweets for everyone. I also wrote HQ with giving the team clear credit for their work, and HQ wrote back saying we did an amazing job (nicest feedback I had gotten that far; was in tears when reading it).

In the end, I couldn't get any positive feedback without a ""but"". The territory manager has been colder to me than usual (I have also been noticeably quieter/standoffish than usual for sure and Japanese people are the most passive aggressive people on Earth).The general admin lady has barely talked to me for the past few weeks which has been awful because she was usually nice to me.

I was going to ask for a raise but the territory manager is so mean-spirited. I'm getting to the point of wanting to leave my dream job. These people have been so awful. I would like to try and work at HQ, but I have had absolutely no success in finding any advocates for me there. I feel like I should talk to Tanaka and see why he's mad at me, but direct confrontation doesn't always work in Japan, and I'm tired of apologizing to these grade A assholes.

Misc. info; we recently had reviews for everyone. I was quite honest (while being hopefully professional and leaving anecdotes out of the reviews). People haven't received their reviews yet and the hammer's coming down on me probably early next week...

I feel depressed and helpless. The most interesting thing about me is this job and I don't know what I would do after this...

Any advice?

I have \~13 of customer service/retail. I was a kitchen manager at my last job.

In January, I had a serious medical episode. I collapsed at work. I should have gone to the hospital, but I was too delirious to know what was happening. I got on a bus and made it home. While this was happening, the owner of the restaurant screamed at me. I was out for a week. When I came back, the manager yelled at me in the office until I had a seizure/panic attack and was hyperventilating on the floor, then left me in the office.

After that, I couldn't be in the establishment without panic attacks. I decided to quit at the end of February. They ended up asking me to stay, and I gave them six weeks longer than was my intention. My last day was April 1st.

I promised myself that I wouldn't go back to kitchen work.

Part of the reason that I had medical issue was the physical and emotional stress of the job. I also have joint and back pain. I won't dwell on it, but I just can't do it anymore.

I decided to look for literally any entry level desk work.

I set up a linkdin and indeed account and have stalked craigslist and indeed, looked at neighborhood facebook groups. I had two friends of mine who do hiring help write my resume and the generic version of my cover letter (I customize it per application). I bought professional-looking clothes for interviews.

Three of my interviews have gone very well, and they were encouraging in their rejection letters. The other three were discouraging. One of the better interviews was Monday, and I haven't been formally rejected yet, but I think it's coming. I will follow up on Monday.

Sometimes I feel like I'm going crazy. Some of the people who interview me seem to be incredibly impressed by my skill pool (it's varied; though I have customer service, I also have an associates in graphic design, am a published author, and have a few years of entry-level coding experience). The one I just got the rejection letter from heaped praises on me, in fact. They basically told me they needed to interview one other person as a formality. I still proceeded with other applications and interviews, but I can't lie: their rejection feels like a punch to the gut.

Some of the people who interview me clearly don't know why I'm there. Two of the interviews have been with someone who chose my resume and also the person/s who would be my manager/s. In both cases, there was clearly a mismatched set of expectations about hiring qualifications between the two. One woman looked at my resume and literally wrinkled her nose and said '*Kitchen* manager?'. I tried to maintain professional behavior, but I knew it was over.

Financially, the writing is on the wall.

I can make this June's rent, but I am neglecting to pay utilities, medical bills from my episode, student loans (deffered), and health insurance. What's more, my pet has a medical issue. I was able to respond to the first emergency, but it requires follow-up that I can't pay for. I'm also low on food.

A few months ago, I was between two job offers — one with a great company and one for a (massive) promotion at my then-current job. I agonized over it for a few days but eventually chose the internal hire position due to higher pay and generally liking my coworkers. I politely conveyed my regrets to the other company and wished them luck.

Well, choosing this position was a mistake. I've tried to stick it out, but it's getting to the point where I simply can't take it anymore (not receiving enough training, no clear expectations, being spoken to very unprofessionally/made cry, etc.). I've been looking at other jobs lately, and found out that the other place is hiring for another (position I applied for).

So my question — is it bad form to reapply there? I had nothing but genuine interactions with those I interviewed with, and it purely came down to money (of course, I didn't tell them that). Am I likely to be seen as flaky, or have my application passed over for having chosen another opportunity? If I manage to get another interview, what do I even say?

I’m at a crossroads and need some advice. Would quitting a job without something lined up be a huge black mark on my record? I’m currently at a job in high net worth wealth management that’s making me absolutely miserable. I love my company overall, but my current team’s culture is toxic and rife with bullies. We’re also working on a soul crushing project through the end of the year which has and will continue to require a great deal of mandatory overtime on nights and weekends. 

I would normally never go against the conventional wisdom to not leave a job before you have a job, but I think pushing through much longer will break me. I’m at the point where I’m having nightly panic attacks due to how much I dread having to go to the office the next day. I’ve also starting having suicidal ideations where I imagine killing myself in the office specifically. I would never act on these thoughts (I think), but the fact that I’m having them at all is worrisome.

I know my situation isn’t healthy, but I’m terrified of quitting with nothing else lined up as I live in a highly competitive and high cost of living area (San Francisco Bay Area). I’m so overwhelmed with the hours I’m working that I can’t even begin to think of applying and interviewing to new jobs, let alone get the mental health help I need. I’m also worried that quitting won’t even give me the relief I’m so desperately craving as I’ll likely be too stressed over being unemployed to fully relax and contemplate what I want. Additionally, I fear the the problem isn’t the job, but me. A part of me thinks I’m just a deeply sad person who will be just as miserable at my next gig, so there’s a chance I would be giving up my career only to end up just as miserable. What are my chances of landing an equivalent or better job if I take time off in order to protect my wellbeing? 

A bit about me for context:

-24 years old - have worked at this company for 2 years. I loved my first team and the overall company culture, but I wouldn’t be able to transition teams until 2020. Company is one of the best names in financial services and has stellar benefits. I’m currently still on my parents’ health insurance.

The 3 days off are intended to be a chance to go home, but much of that time is spent traveling since I’m in the middle of nowhere, and I have to spend hundreds of dollars out of pocket to even leave to go home. The closest grocery store is an hour away, and I do t have days off to even go there. I have to go right after work and it’s a 3 hour ordeal. I have to spend an entire night just to get groceries. I’m not getting enough sleep and I don’t have enough time to eat. 

I don’t see how these conditions are sustainable for the next year. Would I be stupid to leave this situation after only two months here? It just doesn’t make sense to me. I could find another job without too much difficulty that pays approximately the same salary for half the work hours in a much better location. What should I do?

Edit: I’m a field engineer. Commercial construction. Hours are typically long, but not like this. I have many friends who work half the hours as me and are paid just as much.

Today all employees at my workplace were issued a letter stating our hours are going to be cut back by 20% (work 4 days as opposed to 5). We are required to sign and send back acceptance of the proposal in the next two days.

Is this legal?

The individual contract I signed at the start of my employment states I'm on a salary with a regular working week of 38 hours.

I am in a finance position and I know sales have not been impacted to the extent that measures like this need to be put in place. Maybe the board is just taking precautions, but I can't help but feel they are using the whole coronavirus saga as a cover to cut labour costs for the foreseeable future.

I'd like to hear your opinions on the matter. Thanks in advance for the feedback.

EDIT: through my research I can conclude it comes down to the wording of the letter your company provides. If it's a request or proposal to change your hours - totally legal. You can decline to sign and then face whatever repercussions come of that. If the company does not give you an option and adjusts your salaried hours without consent - not legal and you can take the case further if you wish.

Oh, and just for clarification: I am well aware and have been since I starting pursuing a career in sports that it’s a terribly low-paying field, especially at entry level.

My brother is 18 years old, left school last summer, and has been working in a high end fashion/furniture store as a Sales Assistant. He has been there for over half a year now and is thinking of his next step. He enjoys the fashion industry and ideally would want to continue and grow in this field, ideally into more the Design side than just Retail. Retail is a cool start, but it's low pay, hard work and weekend shifts. Not ideal.

Through a networking event at work he got in contact with a Senior Manager from Chanel, and after asking my brother to sketch a super quick design and talking for a good hour, he invited my brother to a week long trial.

The catch? The company is in Paris, France, and we live in London, UK. My brother loves French culture, listens to French music, but his French is basic at best.

The week long trial would be a working interview of sorts during Paris Fashion Week, which my brother has been going on about for years, for a full time job, again in Paris.

My brother, after thinking for some time, has decided not to go. He feels he isn’t ready and is too young. However I feel this is lack of confidence and nerves talking, this is literally his dream job and even if they don’t hire him after the week, the expense of being there for 1 week is surely worth the experience and putting it on your CV? I also think that since he’s in his first serious relationship, and works with the girl in his current workplace, that could be swaying his opinion, although he denies this.

What do you guys think? Should I butt out or push him to leap for this? I understand he's young, but this company is on another level to others and this could be a one-in-a-million chance.

Both have kids the same age, on the PTA together, mutual friends, kids in the same sports league and school. Never dislike but never warm bonding either. 

Here’s the timeline of what all happened:

April: I was working for a smaller  company and it would have been great except the owner was a total psycho and kept firing people. I started applying for jobs; and emailed Leah with my resume, asked if she’d submit it for an open role at her company. I indicated it was no problem And no explanation needed if she said no. This company is kind of sought-after as an employer and has a decent referral bonus. 

Leah emailed me back. Sorry, she wasn’t comfortable working with somebody she knew. This co has 6000 employees in our city and she and I have very different job functions but whatever. 

ETA: I got fired a couple days later; the owner claimed my resume “was seen” on a job board. 

I shook Leah’s email off and applied anyway. In the last year we’d been granted custody of my late cousin’s 2 kids on top of our 3 biological ones. Not cheap. 

I heard a couple snotty comments from Leah about, “god it must be so embarrassing to be fired” and “job searching is so hard” during the time I was out of work. 

I interviewed, got the job and started in May. Turns out my former employer has himself a bad rep. Yay! It’s gone great for me. 

I didn’t reach out to Leah not wanting her to F anything up. I also kept quiet about getting a new job, where I was working, etc around everybody we mutually know. 

Today: I finally saw her in the company cafeteria. She acted all defensive and creeped out, asked me what was I doing there. I explained I’d started recently and she continued to look at me like one would look at a crazy person screaming on the subway about the apocalypse. 

She asked to see my badge, which I showed her, and then said, “great catching up, see you around!” and went back to my desk to eat. 

I got a couple IMs from her that she felt like I was devious to apply for the job knowing she wasn’t comfortable working with me. I pushed back that our jobs haven’t intersected in 6 months, and that in a company this large there must be other people she knows outside of work - there are at least 3 other parents from our kids school I’ve run into. She pushed back that I should’ve respected her wishes and that she felt I’d deceived people. I responded that I was done with the conversation. 

I did screenshot the convo and sent myself a PDF. I mentioned the incident to my boss, who just rolled her eyes and something like, “ugh, thanks for letting me know. You may have to interact with her department in Q1, so I hope it blows over.”

While I had a wonderful time studying it I’m undergrad, it is now blatantly clear that this major does not lend itself too easily to getting a decent job (and Covid certainly doesn’t help). While studying during undergrad, through taking a few statistics courses, I discovered that this area of study interested me. I have been researching graduate programs in data analysis and am thinking about going back to school to get my master’s degree. I’ve read mixed opinions on the outlook of the field of data analytics.

729,"Wasted my 20s. Love to work with words, but zero contacts. Where can I professionally go as I approach 30?",116,eoadse,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/eoadse/wasted_my_20s_love_to_work_with_words_but_zero/,30,"I messed up my 20s. 

*Very* long story short, I suffered a crippling depressive episode that lasted for a good year and a half. I got kicked out of school a few months before I turned 20 and didn’t really get back into it until I turned 22. I was so exhausted from my mental health issues (in my early-20s, I was diagnosed with persistent depressive disorder, ADHD, and clinical anxiety, none of which went treated until I was in my later-20s due to problems with my insurance) that I just wanted to get my degree and graduate. 

And I finally did back in 2016. Since then, however, I’ve been bouncing around from dead-end job to dead-end job, unable to accumulate enough experience or good will to puff up my resume. I’ve landed a great job before (incredible benefits, easy work, friendly enough co-workers), but I struggled so much with the “work from home” aspect that I fell behind and, eventually, was let go. 

I’m turning 30 in a few months and I’m at an absolute loss. I’ve felt discouraged before, obviously, but always with a hint of hope ahead. It’s really hard to be optimistic, however, when you’re reaching the end of what everyone calls “the most important decade of your life” and have nothing to show for it. 

**I went to school for communications.** I didn’t have a specific path to take with it; I settled for the most generic BA I could get that didn’t make me want to blow my brains out. **I love to write, to work with words and grammar.** I’m often the go-to proofreader among my group of friends and was even given the side-gig of proofreader/assistant editor at a few of my jobs/internships. 

The problem is that I have no idea what to do with that. I live in SE Michigan, close enough to Detroit to commute, I guess. Despite Detroit having an expanding downtown filled with flashy companies, none of them are hiring for a job that puts emphasis on writing, editing, or proofreading (at least not on any of the job sites, from LinkedIn to Indeed and everything in between). 

There are a few small publishing houses on the west side of the state (Ann Arbor, Grand Rapids, etc), but there lies the other problem: I’ve never learned how to put together a writing portfolio. I’ve asked my writing professors, but (surprise surprise!) *none of them know.* I’m so glad that what little money I make is going toward student loans I had to borrow for an academic experience in which my professors literally couldn’t offer me the one piece of knowledge I would desperately require after school!

I know I’m rambling at this point, but I’ve been a “long-time lurker” for a while now and I missed a student loan payment this past month due to being unemployed and I’m just picturing my entire fucked-up future flashing before my eyes all because I wasted my 20s. I’m at my wit’s end here, and if anybody would be able to offer a helping hand, I’d be extremely appreciative.",1578978530.0,2020-01-14 00:08:50

I‘ve been at this job for about a year, and the problem is I’m not getting the experience that’s expected for a year in this field. I have past experience as an autopsy assistant, so I’ve been diverted from my actual job position to fill a personnel shortage in autopsy. Pretty much from right after my start date I was told that I’d be working in autopsy for the foreseeable future and getting training in the investigation division when time allows (time very rarely allows). 

Everybody at my office seems to think there’s nothing weird or wrong about being hired for one job, and then having to do the duties of another. I’m getting paid more than an autopsy assistant would, but the reason I was so excited about this job is that it was a way for me to stop doing autopsies! They’re super interesting, but they’re physically and emotionally exhausting and I’m just tired of it. 

I’ve been applying to other positions, but there aren’t a lot of open death investigator positions around. When I have gotten to interview, the lack (I have done some, but I have to take overtime shifts to do them) of actual investigations I’ve done is a real detriment. 

I’m just exhausted with the situation I’m in and I want to leave. I have applications out for other agencies for similar positions but now I’m worried about the same situation happening... is there really any way to ensure i get to perform the functions for the job title I’m hired for when every job description now has the ‘other duties as assigned’ line thrown in?

Here is what happened. In 2017 I moved from my home town (ended a 10 year relationship because he didnt want to move with with) because I was hired by a big tech company in another city. It was my dream job, I worked with tech and wanted a carreer boost and an experience in a big company. Five months later my whole team was laid off. Yes. It lasted five freaking months.

There I was, lonely and jobless. I had terrible depression, suicidal thoughts, I kept thinking there was something wrong with me. Maybe I was being punished by my ambition? But anyways, I was in need of a job I went through all my contacts, scheduled meetings with everyone, reached people I never met on Linkedin. Asked for referrals. Finally I was hired by a small start up 5 months after being fired.

But I still wanted to pursue my dream and I kept trying. A friend of a friend who worked at another big tech company offered me to introduce me to someone he knew who worked there. I grabbed coffee with that person who was simply very happy to help me. He referred me, I went through a long interview process and they made an offer!!!

Anyways, just to tell you: I just started at this company and I am way more passionate about the role I am in today than the role I was fired from. I get to actually make a difference now, since I am part of a small team inside this company.

Anyways, DONT GIVE UP! And dont be ashamed to ask for help, contacts, referrals. Go after what you deserve! And I hope you all have the best of luck :)
Edit: sorry for the typos and everything. I am not american and I wrote this very quickly.

Ps: I had no network in the city I moved to. I just kept introducing myself to people and making my way in like a crazy person. Referrals are very helpful, so that’s what I was looking for.

They offered me an insane amount of money ($90k vs $71k at the state) and they will pay for me to get my masters degree.  My friends are saying this is a no brainer and to take the money, whereas my family thinks the state makes sense given the pension and job security.  

I don't know why I am so skeptical but $90k is such an absurd amount of money for someone my age and with my experience, especially given what I do isn't complicated whatsoever and I can probably do it in 30 hours.

For approximately 7 months, I  have been working in a Business Analyst (BA) role for a utilities company and have previous held the same role position for a financial institute (as work experience for my degree).  I have a general idea of the career as I'm currently educating myself in the evenings so I can start my CPA designation as I see myself in an analysis/accounting role. The job market where I currently live is not the greatest so I applied for basically every entry level analyst job I could find and took the first one I could get (for financial reasons, I needed money and I needed it fast).

Here's the thing - I'm an entry level employee and I'm interested in finding a job where I can learn both  from hands on experience and mentoring, but I understand I have to keep my head down and do the mundane ""chore"" tasks that get assigned to me. Anyways, when I interviewed for the role, I made sure to ask questions about mentorship, where my duties would be focused, areas for growth and potential opportunities to learn, etc. The job was laid out to be an analysis role focused on process improvement and documenting, data gathering, interpretation and modelling. Unfortunately, outside the process modelling, I don't do much of the work mentioned above. 

To make matters worse:

1. There is a huge internal company project going on that limits the amount of money that is spent on projects outside of this initiative - basically new work is not exactly going to happen for the next 2-3 years because of this. 

2. My department is split into two teams: the BAs and the Operational Support team (OS). There is a massive growth plan for the support team because the need for the technology support is growing much faster than the team right now - which makes my role feel even more insignificant.

3. My manager has spoken to me about how my role will be shifting to accommodate the support team and I will likely be acting as a tool for them to use when they need to create/model processes or documentation. 

4. My current projects involve developing internal contests (which we are now not going to run), maintaining a website, documenting communication strategies, creating bi-weekly presentations for a stand-up meeting, other small one-off mundane tasks and supporting a technology upgrade (this one actually makes sense and fits scope).

I have voiced my concern, and my manager essentially responded with training will likely be through hands-on only, and your role will be shifting to more of a support role. I don't want to seem ungrateful because I'm lucky to have a job but I have slim to no mentorship, little support from my manager, and it is turning into a completely different job than I interviewed for. 

As you may have guessed, the culture is not the greatest either but that's beside the point. I feel like I'm stuck in a job where I'm learning near nothing, I feel underappreciated and I'm truly worried for my long-term career. I'm young and looking for opportunities to grow, learn and build a career so I'm a little scared I'm heading into the wrong direction and something needs to be done (I just don't know what).

Anyways, I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, I just feel stuck. I'm just hoping to get anyone's advice on this or personal experience with something similar. Do I continue to voice my concerns or is there something better for me to do? Maybe it's at that point where I aggressively apply to new jobs and quit the one I'm in once I find a new one?

HR accidentally released our manager's W2 so now everyone in the office knows he gets paid $490,000 a year.  This guy plays Pokemon Go all day and doesn't actually contribute, just blows smoke and gets our president (his boss) excited over nothing.  He has been with the company for over a decade and has somehow convinced his boss that he is indispensable, when in actuality he just takes credit of our work. 

The president of the company pays everyone $60,000 a year as base.  Initially, he promised fat bonuses but has failed to deliver for 2 years, even though the company is profitable.  There is no 401K and no salary raise, so my colleague who has been here for 7 years still only earn $60,000 base.  The company dangles a carrot in front of us, saying if we work hard we will eventually be rewarded, and unfortunately the naive new blood buys this lie, which means despite the super high turnover, new grads are still eager to knock on our door.  This just encourages the president to continue his way because he gets away with it.


The job is unfulfilling and involves being deceitful to our customers, so I feel my soul dying a little each day.  The positive aspect is there is no micromanagement, so I am left alone.  I use this time to study and read, and work only about 1 hour each day (it's a 9 to 6 full time job).  The job market here is rough, and with so many of my graduate class still out of work, I *think* I should feel fortunate to have this job, but I don't.

The way a race team works is we go about twice a month to races across the country and every engineer works directly on one car. We have three engineers (me included), so three cars. Being a minor formula, all drivers are paid drivers, so at the beginning of the year we had two drivers already signed up, and one waiting to sign. The missing one was mine, so I participated at the first race following the other engineers to learn from them and be ready. I'm owed those days of work.

Fast forward a couple of months, the third driver has not yet signed up and I'm not being called to races anymore. The team boss says that, since we do not have the third car yet, he can't ""register"" me into the team's payroll (it's legit, the team is structured as a sporting association in Europe and this is the way it works) because that has a cost and he can't justify it now. So I'm been waiting for that payment for the good part of five months and I'm not even getting paid for the other races since I'm not participating. Obviously I was assured that I'd be participating to every race.

Since the boss is not a bad guy, but he is very disorganized and not very fit to run a race team (IMHO), how do I make myself heard and get paid what I'm owed, without ruining our relationship so I can partecipate to future races?

Honestly I feel like that incompetent fool in the office. And I think my colleagues think that way too, although they've never said anything about it, and they have been really nice so far. 
I've seen them rant about other colleagues before to each other, and sometimes I can see that I frustrate some of them with my lack of ability to apply their advice.

My dad tells me that it takes time to learn the skills, and to stick it out - i'll get better with time. That i'm being too much of a perfectionist, and that i'm thinking too much.

To give some background, I am currently 23 and I've had 5 different job roles in the last 3 years. Not all of these have been change of employer, 2 of the 5 have been promotion/relocation to another team. 

My issue is that I can't seem to find satisfaction with the roles I'm choosing. I work in the IT sector and while I have been moving jobs my salary has increased and I am happy with that aspect of my career to be earning as much as I am at my age. 

However, my current job I have been in for 6 months I am already feeling bored and not challenged enough,same as I felt with my previous role where I stayed for just over 1 year, but had promotion in the middle of that time. When I joined my current role 6 months ago the start was very promising there was lots to do, I was given the freedom to innovate and establish processes which is what I love doing. However now I have finished all the important projects, the system I am responsible for is in a good state and I am left doing the boring day to day maintenance which is the part I dont enjoy. 

As a result I have found myself being attracted by LinkedIn adverts and recruiter emails promising better salary for similar/same job I am doing. Issue is, I don't want to be a 'job hopper'. I understand that it looks bad when you have 4 different jobs in 3 years even if you have been climbing up the ladder. Because of that I feel locked down to stay at this place for at least a year or two before I can allow myself to leave. 

I have tried taking onto new projects but the business simply doesn't have the need or resources to start new projects at this point. Am i wrong for feeling like leaving? should I just be ""sitting it out"" for another year and a half?

That month I ended up accepting my current job through someone in my network with total transparency about my plans (the company said they didn't care if I needed to leave four months in). As life had it, our landlord changed his mind about selling the building and the city decided not to shut down our train line.

I've now been at my job since October 2018, and my boss (the one who brought me on) was fired in June 2019.  Since then, I've been handling all of her duties and been a de facto member of our company's C-suite, without any raise, promotion, or official acknowledgement. Including me in these conversations resulted in me leading two company-wide primary initiatives that have turned the business around.

I've repeatedly asked for a promotion, and finally my CEO/(new) boss has told me point-blank that he won't give me the promotion unless I agree not move in 2020.

Meanwhile, my partner still hates his job and we both feel we'll want to finally move next year (we'll likely start our job hunts next month and hope to move by midyear).

Nice to everyone then when it came to me said colleague would have the stiffest face ever. Their behaviour influenced even the most junior members of staff who had zero respect or patience for me.

However our team head is very close with this difficult colleague and I don’t believe he is doing anything given they are close.

Needless to say that this colleague has a lot of social power and I’ve found settling in to this new team INCREDIBLY difficult and toxic.

I’m pretty high up in the company - my boss reports directly to him, and while she agrees it’s not a good idea (after i explained why), she’s still asking me to move forward with it. I told her when she gave me this project that I wouldn’t do it, think it’s a horrible idea/awful thing to do, and don’t want to put my name on it at all. Her response was to not say I think it’s a terrible idea to the CEO because he’s already defensive of this project, and that if shit hits the fan, I can always walk away. 

I can’t do this, and don’t think there’s anything I can do to change my boss or CEO’s minds NOT to move forward with this (my colleague who has been assigned to the project feels the same way that I do, if that matters).

&#x200B;

I worked in investment banking for 6 years straight out of college. This was a stressful, front office, client facing role. I was in the top performing quartile of peers each year, and my immediate bosses had a high opinion of me (not trying to toot my own horn, just hope this might mitigate some of what follows). The 1st section below describes what happened, and the 2nd section gives more personal details (not shared with my former employer). My questions are:

1. Given my situation, do I need to list anything specific on my CV (obviously other than my employment ending on so-and-so date 15 months ago)? I'm thinking of 2 things: do I need to describe how my employment ended? Do I need to explain the \~15 month gap in my employment history?
2. When (if...) I speak to recruiters / at job interviews, what should I say about how my previous job ended? I can explain what happened (kind of like I do below in the ""external perspective""), but I assume when they call my previous employer as a reference they will be told I was fired on bad terms?
3. How do I explain the long gap since my previous job to recruiters? I obviously can't give the ""personal perspective"" below. I was thinking of simply saying ""personal/family issues I had to deal with""

&#x200B;

The story (from an **external perspective**) goes like this: 

The job (and especially one person in the team) was very toxic, I was literally the only junior who managed to stay in that team for more than a year or two (those before me either quit or were fired). Around a year before we ""parted ways"" (more on this below), the stress and toxicity had really gotten to me, and despite the very high pay, I had decided to resign. I tried to resign twice but unfortunately since I was a little bitch, my boss managed to talk me into staying. Ultimately he convinced me to take a sabbatical for a few months and said if I still wanted to leave after that, I was welcome to. 

I took him up on the offer but when I subsequently met with HR in the coming days/weeks, it turned out my boss had told them I needed to take stress related sick leave. There's obviously a big difference between that and a sabbatical - HR made me see a doctor, demanded updates every week, etc. Basically after a few months of this, I went MIA (not answering phone/emails) and a few months after that, the company terminated me.

&#x200B;

The story (from a **personal perspective** \- my employer didn't know any of this): 

\~2 years before I left I started using drugs quite heavily, partly due to the very demanding job, partly due to the toxic co-worker, and partly due to my addictive personality (can't blame everything on the job alone!). No one knew (knows) about the drugs and they never affected my ability to do the job (in fact I achieved my highest rankings vs. peers in those last 2 years). As soon as my ""leave"" started, the drug use spiralled completely out of control, which contributed to depression, which made drug use worse, etc. (vicious cycle). A few months in, I stopped caring about everything, never left my house, stopped talking to family/friends/work. All I did was do drugs and play video games. Some of my family/friends literally thought I had died! This continued until \~8 months ago, when I ran out of money/savings and had to move back in with my parents. On the bright side, hitting rock bottom finally made me get clean - I've been off drugs (but still battling with depression) for around 6 months now. I've finally found the motivation to get a damn job so today is literally the first time I've logged into LinkedIn in years!",1551377626.0,2019-02-28 13:13:46

So I’ve been in this sales role for just over a year now. And I’m good at it. I’ve consistently been a top performer in my team. I’ve had my ups and downs, but mostly ups. This quarter however has been difficult and it is of course a quarter in which I am up for promotion if I hit my quota, which I’m very far from as is everyone else in my department due to overextension from corporate.

And I don’t know if I feel depressed because it’s just been difficult. It’s felt like everything that could possibly go wrong has been going wrong. I’ve been trying to be more strategic. Prospect my clients before calling. Be more aggressive. Be a better professional. But everything has been crumbling.

This is when I thought about the last year and wondered how I felt before things started going south. And upon reflection... not good. Even when I was excelling in my role, I was going home and drinking a lot of days. Difficult clients. Pressure from higher ups. Refund requests. I think the stress from this position has been killing me emotionally and physically more than I’ve been letting on.

But I don’t know what to do. I don’t have any job ideas that I think I’d be good at. I can deal with a pay cut, this job was never about the money, but I also need to pay bills, especially if my fiancé ends up going to law school as she plans to.

I’m developing phone anxiety which is a death sentence for a phone salesman. I can’t stand the idea of doing this job any longer when I just want to enjoy my life outside of work without dwelling on the problems I have in the office, which I do a lot.

I am now going back to therapy to deal with these issues and see how I can manage them because right now everything points to me throwing myself in front of the train that normally brings me to Penn Station (I’d never do that to my fiancé, but FUCK do I want to end it.) When things were going WELL I was killing my feelings with weed, vodka, and sleeping pills. It’s not much better now that things are shitty.

So idk what to do. Do I quit and find a less stressful job? Do I suck it up and see if this feeling passes? Do I go off into the wilderness because I’ll never be happy as long as I’m working behind a desk? I’m fucking lost. And unhappy. And I just want to enjoy my life without worrying about my livelihood being tied to something I hate so much.",1566524476.0,2019-08-22 21:41:16

I have over cumulative 15 years of sales and sales management experience. I had been looking to switch industries and began searching on all the typical job avenues i.e LinkedIn, monster, career builder, zip recruiter, directly on companies website. 

I was shocked to see how dehumanizing the whole process was. 

You see, prior to me thinking about switching industries, all my previous jobs were obtained by referral. Those interviews typically were 1 day interviews with the job offer presented within 3 business days. 

But WOW, what a wake up call, the job search grind was REAL!  The time wasting  waiting to hear anything back became the norm.

It’s become pretty obvious that I’m doing it because I’m looking for another job. What are your thoughts on keeping your LinkedIn up to date while you’re currently working at a job?

I’ve been at my current company for about a year now and I’m looking to relocate to a new city and find a new job there. Of course, nobody at my current company knows that I’m trying to find a new job, but I’ve been doing everything I can to make myself a better candidate in the meantime.

I’ve been updating my LinkedIn and trying to make myself more marketable by adding a professional looking headshot as my profile picture, updating my work experience with some bullet points about my work, and writing a cheesy bio about my skills and what I love about my industry. Also I’ve been getting some certifications through LinkedIn learning and adding those to my profile as well.

Some of my coworkers have seen the changes on my LinkedIn and tease me about it. They make jokes about how it’s suspicious that I’m putting so much effort into branding myself and they hint that I’m trying to leave the company. It’s really starting to get annoying. Yeah, I am branding myself because I’m looking for a new opportunity, but they have such a negative and condescending tone about keeping your LinkedIn profile up to date. They make it seem like anyone who cares about their LinkedIn image is a traitor to their current company.

I think that’s really annoying because now that I’ve taken time to update my LinkedIn, I realized this is something I would do even if I wasn’t considering leaving my current company. If you’re in any type of career, your public image is so important now that the internet plays a huge role in everyone’s lives. Any single person you meet can take 2 minutes to look at your LinkedIn and learn a lot about you, and I think that’s really underrated. 

I hate how I am being judged so negatively by my coworkers for updating my LinkedIn and marketing myself as best as I can. Yes, I admit they’re right about me doing it because I’m looking for other opportunities, but i don’t think updating your LinkedIn in general for the sake of keeping your career progression up to date is such a bad thing. It’s such a taboo subject in the workplace and I really don’t think it should be. ",1554285904.0,2019-04-03 06:05:04

Is this normal?,107,dwrh4r,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dwrh4r/im_told_that_my_boss_needs_to_edit_my_emails/,73,"I started a job about 3 months ago at a hospital. I've run into a very strange situation (or what I think is strange anyway) at work. To preface, here is the ""cast of characters"" if you will:

Physicians at the hospital

Companies we work with as clients

I have two bosses:

Administrative Director

Clinical Director (a physician)

Their boss is: Executive Director (of the department. And above him are higher ups like VPs and CEO of the entire hospital and such)

I am a project manager and my job is to work with hospital-to-industry relationships on behalf of other physicians trying to get funding for their studies. An attending physician asked me to help me with a new company relationship. As we were wrapping up our conversation, he said, ""I think we should all meet together so you, myself, the clinical director, and the executive director are all on the same page and there is no confusion. Could you set up a meeting for us?' I went ahead and sent an email asking if they would like to arrange a conference call. The clinical director (one of my bosses) said, ""Oh yeah, of course. I think that's a great idea.""

Fast forward two days later, I have my weekly check in with the administrative director (my other boss). She's not happy. She says, ""you need to be careful about who you speak to and can't just go off the rails setting up random meetings by yourself."" Apparently, the executive director forwarded an email to the administrative director saying, ""What is this and who is this guy? Can you take care of this?"" And I told her that the attending physician asked to set the meeting up - I didn't realize just asking about people's availabilities would cause such a commotion. Now my boss (admin director) wants me to draft up a report telling her where everything went wrong so she can ""sort this mess out."" She also says she wants me to send her drafts of all my emails before I send it to anyone vertical in the hospital or to another company. In frustration, I spoke to one of my coworkers about the situation (they work in a completely different capacity). They said that's very common and they were told the same thing too by their bosses.

Is this normal?

EDIT: Some people are asking if I reached out to their admin assistants. I did not but I said I'd be happy to reach out to their admin assistants if they were interested in holding the conference call. I didn't reach out directly to admin assistants first because I figured admin assistants wouldn't know the context of the meeting as to whether or not it was worth scheduling one in the first place. My train of thought was more like, see if the ED even wants to talk, get the thumbs up from him, then go to his admin assistant to schedule something because he wants to discuss this matter. I would hate to schedule something, have the ED to come to a meeting, only for him to be like, ""Well, that was a waste of time."" You know?

EDIT: This is borderline naive, but I'm gonna be honest. I thought in a professional work environment with a carefully crafted email that dealt with a minor issue like scheduling, especially when directed by a director-level attending, the worst that would happen is, ""I'm sorry, who are you?"" and people would move on with their lives. No matter how high of a seat you hold. Because, I don't know - people just being kind to one another?

As for my admin boss, I get her embarrassment, but I thought the worst she could be like, especially in a position of a mentor would be, ""I mean, shit sucks man. I get it, but don't do it again."" End of story. Not write a full blown report about the ""mess you've made.""

No matter how much I try to explain it in short, it sounds pathetic. So here's my long explanation:

-Not knowing what I wanted to do, I was just going with the flow - went to business school straight out of high school, got depressed and was only able to do one semester (though I did well in the classes).

-I then applied to a different uni the following year to pursue Education. I do enjoy working with children but to be honest, I only did this to have a sense of security (a clear-cut career path) but all I had in mind was to eventually move out and teach English in Asia (SK or JP). You don't even need a teaching degree for that. Why I want to try living in a different country is, I constantly feel suffocated in my city and feel like there is so much more out there I could be doing. Anyway, I enjoyed taking my foundational/elective courses until junior year (this year) came and was constantly stick to my stomach at the thought of being a teacher here at home. I kept trying to convince myself to stay but I really didn't like what I was learning anymore and I was already dreading the thought of having to do practicums throughout my last 4 semesters. Being a teacher here (was an early childhood major too) was obviously going to be different than teaching only ESL. Eventually, I had to withdraw from my classes as I was having major depressive symptoms again, 10x worse than when I went to business school.

-I'm now taking the semester off to rest and work on my mental health but hoping to go back for a BA in Sociology in January. The motivation behind this is that: 1) all the classes I've done will not go to waste/will get credited 2) I've taken many classes on it and have always found the field enjoyable and interesting, but initially could never choose it as my major as I was worried about my job prospects here at home (STEM, healthcare, business, or die), and 3) really just out of obligation to finish the last 2 years of what I've already started. But then again, I'm in this constant loop of not knowing what career path I want to pursue <-> being afraid to pursue a major I enjoy but not knowing where it can get me long term. I'm still planning to teach English in SK for a few years because you can do that with any degree, but that's obviously not a long term career plan.

-These days I wake up with morning anxiety and I either gradually start feeling better throughout the day, or it just stays with me the entire day, my heartbeat constantly faster than normal. I feel like my anxiety is to the point where it is excessive - sometimes I would just feel empty and have no hope for the future. It doesn't help that I keep pitying myself and even wish I could just disappear and stop being a burden to my family (probably a huge motivation as to why I want to move to a whole different country). My family isn't the type to pressure me to do what they want, they just want me to finish something in school whatever it may be. Being Asian there's also no pressure with moving out ASAP or see anything wrong with being, say, 30 and still living with parents, that's a very western way of thinking I've realized.

-I would also like to mention that while I don't know what traditional career path I want to pursue, I have side hobbies that I've been doing since my first year of college. I am a YouTube content creator and thankfully, it hasn't exactly flopped and to this day I continue to make videos almost every week. I've started making money off of this but definitely not enough to become a career (at least not yet).

Ahh I don't know where I'm going with this anymore. I guess I'm trying to seek reassurance that everything will fall into place or that I can always go back to school (pursue grad school which is usually ideal for BA holders, get a certificate on something I like if I do find what that is, etc.) when I come back from teaching abroad (if I will even be back), or seek a professional's help because maybe my issue is more than just feeling lost in life but also a mental health issue idk. As I'm only 21, I know I have all the time in the world but many people my age are already achieving more than I do - there I go again with comparing myself to others. :(

Reddit is a place where there are people from all sorts of age groups so I would very much appreciate insight from a variety of you - people with experience, people who have changed careers, graduated and are not even doing something remotely related to their major, went back to school for a certificate in something completely unrelated, only found out their ""calling"" in life at 40, etc.

Edit: I think it would be best for me to take advantage of my financial dependence now and go back to business school instead of “just getting the BA and figuring things out later”. I’m starting to realize that one of the major contributors to my everyday anxiety is the fact that if I do pursue Sociology, I’m highly uncertain it won’t set me up for a career or at least a job that will enable me to live a financially independent and comfortable life. 

I’ve said this in the replies below but my passion in content creating on Youtube and having worked with brands have sparked interest in business and marketing that I never had when I went to business school straight out of high school. Through this, I am starting to find my intended career path and I’m willing to take small steps to get a clearer sense of it. The fact that whenever I look at possible jobs/careers/college programs I always lean towards business is telling. 

Trivial, but I’ll be more confident at least to tell people I’m in school for a BBA to become xyz compared to trying to explain why I’m in school for a BA in Sociology.",1570347761.0,2019-10-06 03:42:41

The boss arrived in a bad mood and started pacing around the lobby of the office on the phone.  A few people had just quit and they were trying to figure out what to do.  Standing right outside my door they say:

>""Promote Bill?  He's a medium worker.  Just medium work.  He's not the kind of person we need at this company.""

While the comment isn't necessarily wrong, this feels extremely unprofessional to stand outside my door while talking to someone on the phone about me.  Especially since they probably knew I could hear them through the open door.

After a massive trigger in February, I realized I wanted to do something I’ve always liked even if it wasn’t high paying because life’s too damn short to be unhappy.

Since I graduated five years ago my life has been very rocky and my work history is a mess, with several extended gaps. After moving to California I ended up getting a clerical job related to my degree. I worked there a year and a half but then had a mental breakdown. I moved across the country (to Texas) and spent a year unemployed. I met someone and signed a lease with them. That lease ends in three weeks and my life has fallen apart. Since leaving California I spent a year unemployed and was then forced to take a crappy job at Walmart after failing to find work in my field. I’ve been there two months, busting my ass for peanuts. 

I will no longer be living with the person who I signed the lease with and if I decide to keep the Walmart job I will have to live with a stranger on Craigslist. I feel like I have no reason to stay in Texas (no friends or family here) but if I move back home to Iowa I am worried I won’t find a job at all. I have an utterly terrible work history with tons of job hopping and one two year gap and another year long gap. I will also be leaving this Walmart job after two months, further tarnishing my work history. Walmart was my employer of last resort and now I am quitting them too.

The town I will be moving to is significantly smaller than the big city in Texas I live in now and the employment options aren’t great. But I really feel like I need to retrain and get a practical degree rather than waste my life working  in minimum wage retail hell. I won’t be able to do that if I am struggling to survive in a city where I have no contacts. I would be able to live rent free in Iowa and could focus primarily on my education though I will obviously need to work part time.

I went and talked to a career counselor at my wife's suggestion, but I feel like he wasn't super helpful.

I like movies. I like film. I like everything about it (editing, acting, cinematography, model making, physical effects, marketing and advertising of movies, even film accounting).

I got a job doing VFX 9 years ago. I enjoyed it. I was good at it. I had free time and projects of my own to work on. Life was good.

Fast forward 9 years and things are very different; the industry has changed a lot. The companies I used to work for have done massive rounds of layoffs and closed offices. I've had to move outs of the US to find a job. I am very near the top of my career path (I'm currently supervising about 30 artists and may be supervising as many as 100 before the end of the year) but I feel like I don't want to be doing this anymore.

1. I have basically no free time (this is especially bothering because I have a very young child who essentially never get to see). I've worked every single weekend for the last three months (I don't get paid OT either) and its going get a lot worse before it gets better. This seems to be a general trend for the industry as well. It's probably worse in the company I'm at, but its not great a lot of places.
2. I have no time to work on my own projects/art and even if I did, the company I work for doesn't allow people to work on their own projects on the side.
3. I'm not taking home a lot of money. I'm making an ok salary, but taxes here are almost 50%, the place I'm living is kind of expensive (by necessity) and after living expense I'm pretty close to breaking even. We're able to set aside maybe $100-$200 a month but we're essentially one car problem away from having a negative income. My wife can't work in this country for language reasons.
4. It's not creatively fulfilling.

So I just don't know what to do. I feel like I've invested so much of myself into this career, but now I've reached a place where it seems like there is nowhere else to go, and I don't like where I am. 

I don't want to move up in my career path because those guys have even less free time than I do. I just don't understand having a job where you never do anything but work. What's the point? Why am I earning money if I never leave the office to spend it? What's the point of having a family if you never get to see them?

I don't want to stay where I am because it's kind of a miserable existence. If I move back to the US I don't think I could find another job. Despite having skills and experience, it's a very competitive market and hard to find a job. I applied for a full year in the US (I made myself apply for a minimum of three jobs a week) and I didn't get so much as a interview.

So now what? I have these skills I developed for the last 16 years but I'm just going to move back to the US and...flip burgers or something.

I've toyed with the idea of trying to freelance, but I wouldn't know the first thing about how to find customers for this kind of work. It's usually the kind of thing people go to big companies to have done.

I don't even know what I'm asking. I feel completely lost and unhappy and trapped.

I originally attended 2 years at a university studying computer science, but had to stop going to school and start working due to health issues my mother was having at the time. I had no choice but to live independently, and I couldn't afford to take on more student loan debt to keep going to school so the only option was to work.

10 years later, I still haven't finished a degree because I haven't had much incentive to do so. I kept getting raises, was able to buy a home, pay off all my debt, invest in my retirement, and generally live a pretty good financially secure life. However, it still bothers me that I don't have that piece of paper. No one has ever asked if I actually hold a degree, and I have worked alongside people with master's degrees who were far less capable than me. For some reason, however, it still makes me very insecure.

Going back and finishing a CS degree certainly wouldn't be so that I could increase my earning potential (or will it?). Also, no companies have ever denied me a job citing lack of a 4 year degree.

If I do go back to school, I'd probably have a solid 2 years (60 credit hours) to finish. Not all of my credits transferred to a local university, and I didn't take all of the undergrad general studies years ago because I was more interested in CS at the time.

Financially speaking, it will probably cost between $15-20K to finish. It would also take me for freaking ever because I am working full time and would only be able to take a couple night/online courses (6 credit hours max) per semester.

I majored in English and History (yeah, I know). I graduated in 2008 right as the economy tanked, panicked again, and entered grad school...as a history major. Yeah, I KNOW. I wanted to remain in academia and go into teaching at the university level, but full-time tenure-track jobs in the humanities are so hard to come by that unless you go to a top tier school, you're pretty much SOL. So now I'm in my early 30s and sitting on two utterly useless degrees, and besides stepping out into oncoming traffic, I have no idea what to do with my life and all this wasted time and money.   


I live in the economic wasteland that is West Virginia. I've applied for what feels like every job in every surrounding state that would be a relatively ""easy"" move, but on the rare occasion I ever get an interview, I never get the job. I can't afford to just pack up and move without having a job in the place first; no one's going to let me sign a lease just on the promise that \*maybe\* I can find a job once I get there.   


If I apply for jobs I know I'm overqualified for, I never hear back. No surprise there. But I also very rarely hear back from jobs I'm actually qualified for. I don't even get excited when I get an interview request anymore because I know what's going to happen. And it's not like I go into them like Eeyore or anything; I'm actually a very bubbly, friendly person in real life and I carry myself well in interviews. I'm just never good enough.   


So what do I do when I've already so thoroughly hosed myself here? Going back to school isn't an option. I'm already up to my eyeballs in debt because I took out loans in grad school to help take care of my parents. First gen college student, remember? Easy money when your family's never been above the poverty line. So what can I possibly do to make this situation better? I've been writing and editing online for almost 10 years now, but I have nothing to show for it; it's all been in content mill hell sites and ghostwritten, so I don't even have a byline anywhere. I've worked off and on as a legal assistant in a law firm this past year (yay for layoffs) and my sometimes-boss has told me I need to consider law school because apparently I have a natural knack for it, but again: I am NOT adding another $100k+ to my student loan tab. I can't pay the ones I've already got. I've thought of making a niche in legal writing and turning that into a freelance business, but I don't think I'm cut out to be my own boss.   


How do I try to salvage whatever's left of my life without going back to school and taking on even more debt? I want to help people. I know that. I really think grant writing would be right up my alley. I've volunteered as a grant writer before and really enjoyed it, but getting a job in the field without the marketing/communications/statistics background most commonly wanted seems impossible.

A part from just going with it and getting used to people, is there a route I can take to a well paying marketing job with less interactions, or does it get worse from here? :/

If there's any other less/no people, well paying career paths, please do share. I am truly lost because the people thing is an issue for me :( and I'm bad at it no matter how much I try. I am willing to study subjects on the side if it means I can find something I enjoy.

I realize there is always someone like this either at school and work, but how do I ""get used to it""? 

One job I had, the manager screamed at everyone daily, including me, for no reason other than that was just the way he was. No one was doing anything wrong or not doing their job, but he was a seriously angry person who screamed if you didn't ""look busy"" enough. There was work to do and we were all doing it, but he was never satisfied. They were good colleagues actually, but this manager was the antichrist. 

My last job had a colleague who also threw insane temper tantrums just because she hated almost everyone on earth. She hated young people (we all have ""no work ethic"" according to her 60-something year old mind), people of any color except white, and anyone not American. She would throw things around the office and bully me verbally. I went to the boss a few times because she never did anything to fix this problem, and the boss actually snapped at me for complaining over it too much. Basically I was forced to enable the colleague's behavior like everyone else, so I quit. I cannot just ""get along"" with someone to make them happy, but I also will not argue with someone and act unprofessional like them. 

I'm scared to work now lol to put it bluntly. I'm actually scared of these people because I do struggle with anxiety and having to be around people who are always angry and screaming is a living nightmare for me. I do not like confrontation yet I'm always forced to interact with people who love to fight the entire 8 hour work day.

Is this how my working life is going to be? How do I actually deal with this? Or should I just try to find work at home jobs and/or start my own thing? Offices are horrible places, and I'm not willing to deal with irate colleagues the rest of my life. Being around people like this gets my heart racing and I shake from the anxiety it causes me. I've developed horrible IBS from it all. It's obviously been very bad on my health. At my last job I would have to leave the office because I would cry and almost throw up from the acid in my stomach that would get out of control due to the anxiety of the colleague bullying me and a boss who didn't care about it.

I have a bit of an awkward question. I have been working in software industry for the past 2 years.

I personally love being an engineer since it is a knowledge based profession. You work hard, you study, you get results. You either know the stuff, or you don't. Very simple and clean dynamics.

However I have always had these teammates who were more focused on marketing themselves and polishing their CV rather than actually learning a thing or two, and doing the job. They usually are very dominant and dramatic people as well, often not afraid to pick up a fight or lie.

Now at my current job, except me and another coworker, rest of the team is focused on exploiting company resources to interview with other companies. I mean I can handle one rotten apple every now and then, but having an entire team that is lying to manager (they make up a story together) and manipulating him in order to get those resources so they can interview with FAANG or some start up is just insane.

I mean yesterday I was ill, took a sick leave, and I asked my team if someone can switch with me regarding a task at 9 am. Only that colleague helped me and he only did that afternoon. They practically didn't even responded me for half a day. How on earth I am supposed to work like this ? This is not even limited to times I am on leave and need help. It is just everyday behavior.

These people are like a cult. They have no shame, no ethics, nothing. Most of them are not doing anything for months but claiming they are just busy and get aggressive if you ask more about their work. When given a task they are doing extremely poorly yet still blame the client for being unhappy.

It looks like this is what the market is all about. Anyone who can talk about some generic concepts or simple architecture and a BFS algorithm seems to get the job but cannot do the job itself, rinse and repeat.

Am I being naive continuing to work hard to learn things ? Should I let go of work ethics ?",1570128077.0,2019-10-03 14:41:17

Is there a limit on how many times you can reach out to a person to ask for a reference? I don’t mean in one job hunting session, I mean throughout the years.

What is the etiquette around asking someone for a reference who you haven’t spoken to since you worked together? Assuming you had a good working relationship and you’re connected on LinkedIn but never really interacted since then. From what I’ve read you’re supposed to keep in touch with your references but just from a personal level I have zero interest in talking to any old coworkers who I wasn’t super friendly with.

815,"Girls, what would you do if you noticed that your boyfriend (and colleague) is treated better than you in your same workplace, with same duties?",102,ex2eam,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ex2eam/girls_what_would_you_do_if_you_noticed_that_your/,27,"I [21F] feel like I'm being treated differently in my new workplace. I know I should probably be quiet because I receive my salary, and this is what job is supposed to give you. However, I'm really hurt. I feel bad, with no gratification. The fact that I'm always treated differently makes me feel like I'm a bad person and I don't know what to do.

Let me first tell you that the job consists in taking care of animals for a company. We DO NOT have personal relationships with our superiors because we don't work together. Our job is really lonely and nobody sees us when we work. The only way our superiors know we have done the job is because we sign a paper when we start and finish the job: nothing more. No personal relationship to justify such behaviours.

I, biology student, got hired after a regular job interview. It went amazingly: they seemed to be really happy about what I did and how I think. I felt like I had found the right place for me.
After the interview I was asked to work 6 hours every day for my first month in order to do some practice, even though I got hired to work during the weekend. After that, I just did my weekend job.

On the other hand things have been a bit different for my boyfriend [26M], psychology student, when was hired. He got the job because he was unemployed and after a few months working there I suggested him to try the interview as well even if the job isn't consistent with his studies.

The interviewers knew he was my boyfriend and I think this helped him being hired: he told me that when they found that out they said nice words about me and their attitude changed instantly towards him too. He was also prepared because since I did the interview before him I knew exactly what they were looking for and I gave him some advice too.

However, the differences in the treatment between us were clear from the beginning.

In chronological order:

First of all, during the interview they gave my boyfriend free gadgets and a book. I have never received anything from them and I'm sure it's not because I'm a bad employee or something.

In addition, nobody asked him to work 6 hours everyday for the first month to do some practice like I did, even if he needed it more than me (at least I'm a biology student and I studied zoology, he is a psychology student and knows NOTHING about animals). He started immediately with the weekend job and at the moment we have the same duties.

Furthermore, at Christmas he received a present from the company (nothing personal: if that was from a friend, I wouldn't be bothered) and I didn't. I honestly don't care about the present: it was nothing I wanted or needed, but I was hurt by the fact that I wasn't (again) treated equally.

Moreover, he got his contract renewed only after 3 months he got hired. They told me I was going to be having it renewed too as well, but besides words, no facts. I had to ask THE DAY BEFORE its validity passed and only then they renewed my contract. And also, I noticed that my contract is shorter than my boyfriend's one, for no reason. Same job. Same duties. Mine will last until 11/2020; his will last until 12/2020. I've worked there for a longer time, plus I did a month full time too and I don't know how to justificate this difference between us: I worked more and I'm more prepared. Never caused troubles, always had a positive attitude and I'm friend with every colleague now.

Finally, yesterday we received our salary and he got 1/3 MORE than he was expecting (we are paid for the amount of hours done), while nobody ever gave me an Euro more.

What do you think of this situation? What do you recommend me to do?


TLDR: same workplace and job, but even if my bf got hired after me and the job isn't consistent with his studies, he was given presents and my same duties without the daily 6-hours month of practice I was supposed to do and receives a higher salary and better contract renewal.

I had stayed for a year and it was the longest year of my life. The job was 100% travel, I was frequently required to work 60+ hour weeks, management was unsupportive, and there was a severe lack of training, resources, and staff. I took 4 months off to recover from health issues related to my job, then 4 months later I landed another position.

I have been with my new company for about 3 months now, and unfortunately, it shares many of the same problems as my old company. Though the work itself is ideal for this stage in my career, the company culture is extemely toxic, and I am miserable. Here are some things other people have said about my new company (which I can agree with, from my short time there):

* ""HIGH turnover.""
* ""Terrible work culture.""
* ""Unrealistic expectations.""
* ""Stifling company culture adds to low morale."" 
* ""Lack of resources from excessive penny pinching - both manpower and equipment - to do efficient work.""
* ""Severe lack in manpower due to high turnover, which results in other employees being overloaded.""
*  ""You will not be treated like you are human, they do not value or respect their employees.""

Shortly before I accepted this position, 4 out of 5 team members all left within the same month. Then I was hired, and now the 5th team member is leaving, meaning I will be the only person left working under my manager (who is the cause of the mass exdous). Things are unlikely to change and I have to go. 

At this point I have 3 options:

1. Submit my 2 weeks notice immediately. If I do this I will have 5 months of experience on my resume (May-Sept).
2. Submit my 2 weeks notice in a month. If I do this I will have 6 months of experience on my resume (May-Oct).
3. Wait until I have something else lined up.

I understand that it is always ideal to have another job lined up before quitting, but I really want to leave ASAP. Every day at this place feels like a week, and I have constant anxiety. I don't sleep well, and a lot of my time outside of work is consumed by thinking about work, and trying to figure out how to get out of this situation. I also want to add that I have money saved up for maybe about 6 months of unemployment.

My biggest concern is how this will look on a resume. Is 5 months enough time to leverage my experience to help me land a similar position with a different company? Is there any difference between staying 5 months versus staying 6 months? If I have 8 months of unemployment followed by 5 months at a job and another period of unemployment, will that make me look ""unhireable""?

I currently have a pretty well paid job, flexible working hours, get on with the team, work remotely... everything is pretty good.

And I want to get the hell out.. I'm honestly really tired of the industry. I'm sick of a desk job.. I just find the whole thing so damn boring, every day is pretty much the same, doing the same stuff, working on the same product over.. and over.. and over, hell.. I don't even find the product interesting!

I've reached the point where I just don't want to do this any more. But I just don't know how to leave, all my qualifications are very focused around software development/testing/Jr. Devops, so is my experience over the last 7 ish years.

Whats even worse is that I have absolutely no idea.. none, nada, zilch ... of what I *actually* want to do. I suppose what I'm asking isn't really for a *How to Guide* but maybe some stories of folks who have managed to do something like this and what their path looked like, perhaps I could get some ideas.

I know that I should be grateful for what I have because I'm lucky, and I really am, but on the other hand I can't help feel like this isn't for me (at least not any more) and if I don't do something it will eat me up.

Just to make it clear, no I will not just quit, bills need paying and I need to eat, so I'm very prepared to just suck it up and do what needs to be done until I don't need to any more.

I'm attending my first APA conference soon and I'm not sure how to present myself. 

Here's a backstory: I graduated (undergrad) in May 2019, with a BA in psychology and a minor in business administration. While most people get a job related to their field after they graduate, I had the opposite experience. A few months after graduating, I had to quit the job I had during my time in college to go through 3 hip procedures, a few steroid injections, the list is nauseating. Anyways, I've experienced progressive pain for the last 2 years, and have been diagnosed with Piriformis Syndrome and Sciatica. After graduating, it seems like my body decided to just freak out and forget how to function.

In a perfect world, I would go to a doctoral program for clinical neuropsychology or have a position at a facility for clinical research. But as things currently stand, I have a degree that I'm sitting on, no school affiliation, no past internship, little to no experience in my field, no job, and possible limitations on my future due to my pain. 

This conference will be full of accomplished doctors, with years of experience, achievements, publications, all the works. During any networking, getting to know people includes asking about what they do or what they're working on. What exactly am I supposed to say about myself? *""Yeah hi, I'm an insomniatic blob of pain and don't really know if I can function well enough to complete grad school but I love research so do you have any job openings?""*

Any advice would be great, as it's quite intimidating and I'm very nervous about self-presentation when there isn't anything to present.  *Thank you in advance!*",1580485274.0,2020-01-31 10:41:14

Basically, I've been working for my current company for about 6 years now. It's the only professional job I've ever had and I've steadily moved up from financial analyst to VP. My boss is the CFO and he's very absent. I probably have talked to him four times this year. I heard that my company was closing it's doors through the grapevine, and I confronted my boss about it and he confirmed it was true. He told me I had 6-18 months (\*scratches head\*). He told me that he supports me wanting to leave but needed appropriate notice. He didn't specify what this was. My workload is either crazy stressful or non-existent. Has mostly been non-existent for the past couple year. To keep me around, I have a high salary and position title because they need me for this model I built that nobody else knows how to operate, but that's about it.

Anyways, I've been following this new company for 6 months and a job opened up that I thought I'd be a good fit for. Same pay, better benefits, same location...new coworkers lol. Nervous about it but I think that I'm finally ready to leave and start learning again. I passed the first interview and the excel test and have the final interview this Thursday. So my question is this: how much notice do I need to give my boss? My only motivation for this is that I want my annual bonus which I would receive in February. I think it's plausible I would receive this because my company laid off a bunch of people in August and gave them three months notice and also the bonus they would have received in 2020. I think that is generous of them. I know that I'll have to train somebody on how to use my model, though it also occurred to me that they might keep me on as a contractor? Has anybody ever seen this before? Also for this new job, do you think I need to be completely transparent that I haven't spoken to my current employer about leaving? I am worried my current position will need me to stay a month and that will be too long for the new job. Am I just being too anxious about this switch?

UPDATE: I am in the US, and I have a final final interview this Friday with the new company. I appreciate all the feedback - you guys are so helpful! If I get the job, I am going to wait until I have an offer letter, and then I am going to tell my boss that I am willing to do whatever it takes to ensure my workload is covered by an existing employee. And then ask for a severance package similar to the people they laid off. Truthfully, my boss is a really nice guy and I think he might be willing to give me my bonus in exchange for ensuring all of my reporting etc is taken care of. My fingers are crossed for this one.

I'm still passionate about music and ideally I'd want to make it my career, but I've found it hard to concentrate on a particular thing ( I play guitar, I play bass, write songs) and have largely lacked the the motivation to dedicate myself to it.

Since graduating, I've been working part time as a writing and remedial math tutor between two community colleges. I also maintain a handful of guitar students to teach and gig fairly regularly. Honestly I like what I do, especially the music stuff, but I probably only clear about 20k a year and that is simply not enough, especially when I consider my age, what my peers are earning, and the lack of advancement of my part time job. 

Essentially, while I know I'm still gonna pursue music in some capacity, I want the piece of mind of pursuing something I can actually make a career out of. And maybe that is music, but I don't know how to get there. 

I do have some ideas. First, I know I've pretty much ruled out pursuing higher ed or public schools. While I enjoy teaching one on one, I don't think a classroom setting is for me and the cost of furthering my education for that hardly seems worth it. I am however very analytically minded, and feel like I'd make a good technician of some sort, whether that's in repairing guitars and other instruments, or working with audio/visual, or with electronics. 

It's also worth mentioning that I have a basic accounting certificate and could be an entry level bookkeeper, but I've done a bit of that work and don't particularly enjoy it, and the hourly pay was much lower by the hour than my tutoring job. I am very good with numbers and precise though.

I know I have a set of skills, I just don't know how to organize my thoughts and concentrate on one thing to really get a career going. Does anyone here have any thoughts?",1569585469.0,2019-09-27 07:57:49

This usually means I’m sitting by myself for hours without seeing another person. It’s kind of lonely.

When I was 7 my coach discovered that I was talented. I landed doubles and almost triples by the time I was 8. However, due to a combination of not understanding how life works, my parents discouraging me, and growing a backside after puberty (for lack of a better word)...I ended up not practicing enough. By the time I was 12, I wasn’t improving fast enough and quit. 

To this day I don’t love anything else as much as I love skating. I wonder what would’ve happened if I’d practiced more. If my parents hadn’t said so many discouraging words. My dad especially had a temper. He would lash out at me and make me feel worthless. My parents would tell me I’d never be anything, this was just a phase and would yell at me so much before my lessons that I’d get upset. Then when I got home they’d give me so much work to do and tell me how selfish I was. 

I remember all the other parents who would cheer their kids on at competitions. Who would encourage their kids to practice. Some parents were even willing to homeschool their kids so they could pursue their dreams. I watched kids who weren’t as talented as me surpass me because they had worked harder, largely because their parents supported them. 

Maybe if I had those parents, I would’ve made it to nationals. Maybe I would’ve ended up skating for a traveling show. Two of my coach’s students made nationals. One of them wasn’t as talented as me to begin with but had really nice parents and worked really hard. This makes me think I really did have a chance. 

I’ve tried skating for fun and thought about getting a coaching license. But I’d be bitter about my wasted potential.

I graduated college a few months ago and I am starting my first job as a mental health specialist next week. It’s an amazing opportunity I’m very thankful for. I still resent my parents for having discouraged the one thing I loved more than anything else. I still think about what could’ve been and the fact that I might not find anything I like better. I hear a song, or it’s cold out, and I want to go ice skating so badly and there’s no other way for me to let it all out but I can’t. I have this gut feeling that I won’t find anything better. And my life is just not going to be the best it could’ve been. 

This is a very specific experience, but I’m wondering if anyone has gone through something similar? If you ended up finding a way after an athletic career ended? ",1554048332.0,2019-03-31 12:05:32

Been contemplating suicide several times and should've probably sought after therapy of some sorts, just to give you an idea of my mental state for the last couple of years.

&#x200B;

Basically couldn't land a job after my bachelors degree due to lack of experience and poor social skills. Went to several interviews, but they always choose someone else. My lack of confidence is always leaking through my answers and me trying to straight up give a false impression will always fail so I've been mostly giving straight answers, even though it will sink me in the end. Keeping up a facade would be impossible for me as I'm an introvert and have a hard time with a severely damaged self image.

&#x200B;

So since my degree I went back to my work full-time at a local industrial production company and worked there for 3 years. My boss would always complement me on helping out and working extra etc, whatever you could wish for as a reference to a next job in a new career. 

&#x200B;

But with time passing by and being stuck with a, to be honest, shitjob even tho I had a degree the field was ""screaming for"", my mental state straight up sank to levels I didn't know was possible. So I quit my job just to break the cycle. All it did was me ending up in a bubble and a far worse depression. 

&#x200B;

Now it's been 2 years and I don't know where to go from here.

So I just graduated from uni this year (lucky me, during a pandemic) and I am now taking a gap year before my masters so I can do some internships since I have zero practical experience. 

I have been applying for a month or so and have now gotten my first offer. The job is at a pretty new start-up seems good and interesting, pay is alright too. It's in a big city (EU) about 3 hours away from me so I'd have to move which is what I want though. 

Now the issue: The internship would be 3 months instead of the 6 months that I wanted. My boss said there could be potential to extend it but we'd have to see afterwards. 

If I take it I would have to hope they'd extend it but also start looking for another internship in October which would be really stressful and seems like I would get no break. On the other hand, I'd have to look for another flat after the three months and plan another move so I feel like it would be A LOT at once. (Also who knows how the job market will be with Covid and all) 

If I don't take it however I am scared that I won't find anything else and missed my chance of doing something practical and interesting. 

PS: I also have 2 more interviews next week but obviously I cannot stall accepting the position since I would start the week after. (A later starting date is not possible)

Created a throwaway account due to sheer embarrassment. I am 26F, living in Toronto. I have 4.5 years of work experience. 4 years with a big financial services company where I was a business analyst and a project manager. I loved working there, however after 4 years I decided to move elsewhere so I could grow. Actually, I was pretty desperate to switch towards the end as my old company started going through a lot of changes. I still loved my job but wanted to move to a place with a better culture.  I got a higher paying job with a promotion with this investment management company. On paper it sounded very cool and I thought I would be doing the exact same things that I loved doing at my old job. However, once I joined, I found out it was far from truth. They had just drafted the role in such a way that I would say yes (the new company reached out to me and was very keen on me joining). I hated being there. I hated doing my job because it wasn't what I signed up for. On top of it, my manager made my life hell. She had no trust in her employees and kept a close eye on my monitor. If I stopped working for a min, she would start questioning me. This was also the time when I was going through A LOT at home. My brother who abused me during childhood moved in with me with my parents. My parents knew what he did to me but still insisted I put it behind me and become the bigger person to improve his life. With the stress from home and work, I got majorly depressed and went into a very dark place. Finally I decided to quit my job after being there for 5 months because I wanted time off for myself.

&#x200B;

It's been a month since then and I managed to kick my brother out. I have been actively applying for roles but I just dont hear back. When I was employed, I was actively applying too and I would hear back from 3/10 places I would apply to. I have a strong background and have worked for Fortune 500 companies only. But now, there are NO replies. I am still depressed and working on myself but it feels like I committed a career suicide by quitting only after 5 months. It makes me look unreliable or that I was fired only after 5 months. I know a month is a short time but 0 replies after having a strong resume is really pulling me down. The only responses I get are rejections. I am trying to look into going back to school also but everything just feels like dead end to me. I don't want to go back to that job I just quit because it was hell working there. Any advice or input would be appreciated. If anyone is willing to review my resume, I would appreciate it a lot as well!

Firstly, thank you so much for taking the time to read my post. I'm 25, and after much deliberation, I quit my job a few days ago. As a brief background, I studied economics at university for 4 years, then upon graduation spent 2 years in investment banking. I quit that job in March to pursue an opportunity at a renewable energy company in an attempt to align my job more with my values, albeit the role was still working within mergers and acquisitions and exhibited the same stressors as my investment banking job. I quit this job a few days ago without much of a plan, although I am in a fortunate enough position to be able to sustain myself for the next year or so.

Reasons I quit: - Work/life balance. Upon graduating, I was full of energy and was not daunted by the long hours that characterise the finance industry. This energy, however, soon disappated. With little personal time, I miss greatly the things I used to do for enjoyment, such as reading, drawing, rock climbing and spending time with friends and family. I also am not motivated by money or status, so I found it difficult to justify continuing my career path. - Changing personality type. Before picking my university degree subject, I took several Myers-Briggs tests and was coming out as a strong INTJ, which to my knowledge would make me suited to finance/analytical type jobs. I took the test several times again recently and I'm now coming out as a strong INFP! Of course, I try not to define myself by four letters, but I think the change in my personality type can go some way to explaining my low mood. Numbers no longer interest me like they used to. I am good at analysing and manipulating data, but I don't see it as the means to an end. Rather, I see analysis as a supplementary tool to further my understanding of how I perceive the world. Spending endless hours in front of a computer screen has really worn me down. I miss having frequent interactions with people and nature and have a preference for honesty/integrity rather than doing all I can to get a deal/project approved. - Mental health. My mental health has taken a huge dent over the past few years and I was approaching breaking point. I began to freeze at work and could not function properly. I believe I have high levels of anxiety and a low mood currently, primarily driven by the career I have pursued up until now. I don't perform well in a high pressure environment.

My high level plan for the future: 1. Take a few weeks out to relax, catch up with friends and begin to try and enjoy life again by doing things I enjoy. I also plan to start seeing a counsellor to discuss the difficulties I am experiencing in relation to my anxiety and low mood 2. Find a low stress, guaranteed 9-5 job that I can coast on until I figure out where I'd like to take my career next. 3. Once I know what I want to do next, take time to go back to school (if necessary) and pursue my ideal career.

What I ask from you: I am quite certain that I want to turn my back on finance, however I am struggling to generate alternative career ideas. I have not developed my skill set outside of finance, so nothing really stands out. I have a preference for a career in which people are the main focus and where there is an element of being outdoors. I'm not overly bothered about utilising my economics degree in some way, as I fear that most jobs that an economics degree lead to do not match my values or personality. Furthermore, I view my degree as a sunk cost so I am not concerned about ""putting it to waste"". I kindly ask you how I should go about determining what career I'd like to pursue, and equally if you have any career suggestions that you think I may like based on this post I would love to hear. I am to retrain for a year / on the job, but taking another 3/4 is probably a stretch too far.

Wondering what reasons exist not to do that that I may not have considered yet.  

I'm in the military with a gross annual income of about $92,000. I've decided to leave once my contract is up in early April instead of reenlist. I'm stationed in Maryland but I really want to move back home to Colorado, I've just been holding out for a decent enough job there. I figured it wouldn't be hard to land a job here in Maryland (basically doing the same job I have in the military but as a civilian) so my plan was to do that first just to keep paying the bills while I look for a Colorado job.

I interviewed for a Maryland job on Wednesday and a Colorado job on Thursday. Both sent recommendations to HR to hire me, and both hiring managers said this almost certainly means an impending job offer. Maryland job pays $118,000 and aligns perfectly with my experience, while the Colorado job pays around $66,000 and is a sort of partial career shift since it aligns with only part of my experience. Now you probably think I'm crazy for preferring the Colorado job but living there is my dream and I'm not happy here in Maryland.

Anyway, I *could* just accept the Colorado job and decline the Maryland job. But I'd be lying if I said I don't want to collect at least one month of that fat salary from the Maryland job (about $9,800 gross) before moving to Colorado to start the other job. And the Colorado job could probably be flexible with the start date by a month or two. But of course, that means I'd be having the Maryland company commit whatever resources to getting me spun up on that job only to quit soon after.

Both companies do a lot of government contracting work. The Maryland company even has jobs out in Colorado too, similar to the Colorado job I'd be taking. If I leave Maryland company so soon, do you think it will burn the bridge for any job opportunities with them in Colorado? Is there a way to mitigate that aside from NOT leaving so early? Do you reckon it could damage me professionally beyond my relationship with the Maryland company, like other companies finding out how I left that company?",1581686226.0,2020-02-14 08:17:06

I’ve been in my position w current org for five years now. Over that time I’d guess my overall skills pertaining to this position improved 50%, and the job has undoubtedly gotten more complex.

I’ve only gotten positive yearly reviews and feedback. Last year I asked my manager (and his manager) what it would take to get to the next level, and was not given an answer, just lip service. Lack of path forward is a complaint I’ve heard from all of my coworkers, and as such we face increasing turnover.

To add salt to the wound, yesterday I compared my first paycheck in early 2015 with this company to the most recent paycheck and the difference is lesser than increase in inflation for that time period. That is, I effectively make LESS now than I did when I was hired. We’ve also lost some benefits and now pay more for healthcare, compounding this issue.

What next? Do I threaten to leave without a substantial raise, or do I just get out? Only issue is current job is walking distance from home, comparable position elsewhere would include :30 commute.

Yes, I should have addressed stagnant wages years ago, but the last few years have been very busy on a personal level and I just haven’t.",1576106768.0,2019-12-11 18:26:08
869,I want a different career but I am constrained by my experience and financial difficulties. I have no idea what to do or where to go. What can I do?,91,dnkk26,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dnkk26/i_want_a_different_career_but_i_am_constrained_by/,69,"I'll summarize my educational background as succinctly as I can. I got a bachelor's in neuroscience, and a master's in biotechnology. This was with the goal of getting into medical school, which did not happen. After a year of trying to get a job after the master's program, I got into a doctoral program for biochemistry. Due to a variety of factors, including the program director bungling up my qualifying exams, I quit the program after 3 years.

Since then, I haven't been able to find a decent job. My master's program director said I should command a job at least $20/hour, which has been proven to be a bald-faced lie or moronic oversight. I hadn't had a full-time job until this year, and only one paying that rate for two months. After leaving the doctoral program, I worked for 1 year at a grocery store, and 6 months at an overnight veterinary diagnostic lab. I've been at my current job for 2 months now, as a research assistant at a university. Despite promises, it offers no clear way up or any substantial pay increase whatsoever.

Now, here's where I'm having difficulty. I want to switch to a different career, but I have a few obstacles.

The first is money. I still have to pay off student loans, and I have no desire to go into even more debt for a pricey program that doesn't even guarantee a job afterwards. I already did that with my master's, and I have spent now more than 2 years job hunting for scraps. I'm not forestalling my life further playing this rigamorale in order to pay off loan shark, bloated debts.

The second is job hunting itself. The whole process is a joke, compounded by so-called professionals who give contradicting advice on how to write resumes, apply to these job boards, and whatever else. My university's career counselor is a quack with no idea what he's doing. Recruiting agencies like Aerotek either find me nothing or ignore me entirely. Networking events have netted me nothing. I have no idea where to go to get a career plan in place. Moreover, am I being ignored because I'm seen as inexperienced? A job hopper? I shouldn't be, considering I've had at least 3 years experience doing research, and my other jobs, while short, had to be taken or else I couldn't eat.

**Long story short**, I want out of my career field of research to find a decent paying job with some growth but I cannot afford more schooling (I'm still paying of my master's, thank you very much).  I have no idea how to navigate the fog of confusion and contradiction that is job hunting either. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated. I'm nearly 30, and I'm scared stiff that I've pigeonholed myself into a dead-end career path that I can't escape from.

I will be 23 in December and I'm from eastern Europe.  
I was always a very good student and last year I got my bachelors degree with honours in Economics (from a respected EU public uni). During the last few months of my studies I started an internship for a very well known financial company, it was supposed to be something to get some experience and pay the rent but I ended up getting a permanent offer with a decent salary and I took it. My mother did not approve as she said I should have gone for a masters degree, but I convinced her to let me work one year to save some money and decide later on.  
Well that moment has come, I've been kepping the foot in two shoes so far and I have all the options open but I need to take a final decision within a month.  
I'm doing great on my job, and despite being obviously very junior I'm getting a little bit of responsibility, I'm being sent on business trips by myself, my boss likes me etc. I like the position but probably I won't want to stay in it forever.  
My mom's point is that without a masters degree I might encounter some closed doors in the future which I totally agree on, but then maybe experience trumps the qualification?  
I would not study and work at the same time, I have a demanding job in terms of time and commitment so it would not work. The masters degree is a 1.5 / 2 years commitment (depending on the thesis).  
I make decent money especially compared with friends my age who are either studying full time or working as waitresses and secretaries. My mom is ready to support my basic expenses for the duration of the master that is rent and basic living, but it would be a downgrade from having a salary since I would feel bad spending too much if I don't earn the paycheck. Family is not very wealthy but we do more than ok money wise.  
  
I really don't know if I should give up this job where I'm (I think) kept in high consideration and the company is one of the world's top institutions. On the other hand, what if few years from now I want to develop into a position requiring an higher degree? Or I want to go live abroad and they don't consider me for that?  
  
EDIT: thanks so much for all the good and motivated advice!! Just to clarify I'm not talking about an MBA but an MSc, or however it's called the natural progression of a Bachelors, and it would not put me in debt since education is nearly free in my country. I think I will do as it was my idea and work few years then when I have more clear ideas go for higher education, it's the best way to go and mom will get over it soon enough (and unleash her overprotective wrath on my little sister who's coming of age!!)",1565035281.0,2019-08-05 16:01:21

I dread going into the office and it's not even for a reason other than being trapped and just not happy. I am so bored and yes I can ""switch"" jobs but I already have done that 4x and I just find no fulfillment in these stupid corp jobs. I find myself jealous of labor jobs like the custodians or the landscapers because it's like you have a more tangible impact and can see results of your work. I don't even know if 9-5 even exists anymore because every corp job I've held was always 8-5 and when you commute on top of that, your entire day is gone and energy as well. 

My friends/family just say go back to school or change careers but do people really thing its that simple? When I used to work as a recruiter it was almost just thing stamp that that was ALL I was and even when I networked it was all people wanted me to step into a company as. I hated recruiting and fell into the maybe I could get into HR from being a recruiter once I got in with a company, this has NEVER been the case. 

Now I am at this point were I just can't get myself to go in anymore but whats the alternative? I can't really think of a job that I would enjoy more that would pay decent. Money isnt everything but end of the day, I am alone and can't just not pay my mortgage and I do not have family that could help. 

I hate that I live for the weekends and then the weekends come and its chores and then decompressing from work then going back to work and feels like I am wasting my life. I realize my happiest part of the day is coming home to my dog. It'd be great to work with dogs, but I applied to a few dog places and 1. I don't have experience and 2. Its almost a red flag to places that I am at a high level job wanting to be a dog walker. 

I'm an introvert and every job I look at is so involved with other people and I just want to keep to myself and just complete tasks. I don't particularly have any ""skills"" and just have a bachelors of science in psychology. I have no clue what other alternatives are out there that are feasible. 

I am I know probably everyone else out there wishes that they could just not work or work part-time but I feel like at every job I have, after 1-2pm I just zone out. It's almost pointless to pay me because I have no attention left for the bullshit. I have no problem working hard and used to work 13 hour days back when I supervised a retail store, time flew and I never noticed. Now I just stare at a clock all day watching paint dry because its more interesting than whatever stupid pointless corp assignment I am working on. I wish I had ideas to even start my own business or something but with no ideas, skills or anything I just feel a bit defeated. 

I guess long story summed up, I hate my corp job but wondering what alternative freeing or work from home or on your own schedule jobs that pay decent. Seems like a stupid fantasy but honestly curious does anyone have a job that actually like and enjoy going to?

Not sure where to go, especially in these weird times.

So I have a biology degree with a focus in ecology and conservation. I’ve had numerous internships and some research experience. I found in the past four years of university that I despise academia, so going back for grad school won’t be happening any time soon if I want to keep my head on straight. 

Personally, I feel the urge to go to community college and get a trade certificate...maybe I’m ungrateful for my degree, but I simply can’t see how I am marketable in the work force with the degree I have. I have learned that I’m a very hands on person, which is why I’m leaning towards learning a skilled trade.

On the other hand, I’ve also had an interest in GIS, so I could easily get a certificate in GIS which would pair nicely with my current degree. However, I have become quite opposed to desk work in the past year. 

All in all, I feel quite silly for the degree I got and further confused because I’m a much different person than I was when I started school in terms of work ethic...maybe I’m not different, but I certainly have learned more about who I am and what I think I desire out of life.

Thanks for simply reading through this little rant. Feel free to ask questions if you’d like to hear more about my situation/if you feel I’ve left anything out.

875,What's so bad about being a lawyer?,95,b21r54,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/b21r54/whats_so_bad_about_being_a_lawyer/,19,"A letter to unsure future lawyers


Given to me from my law/legal professor in undergrad. I told him I was on the fence to becoming an attorney, and he sent me this.

Mr. A,

I always tell my students that I am but one side of the coin of the profession of law. There are lot of downsides to this profession. To get there in the first place you have to generally expend a decent amount of money (college, LSAT prep and the actual test, applications etc.). Then you have to take out generally $150k-$250k to actually go to school. Your loans will be at a rate of 6-12% depending on how lucky you are, but in general the interest on those loans is going to be insurmountable unless you get a very high paying job and really sacrifice your quality of life for several years.

Once you've gotten there, the study is unlike anything you've done before - 14-18 hour days are not uncommon. Once you begin to practice, you are exposed to routine long days, verbal and mental abuse from your superiors and clients and all so you can make low 6 figures with the possibility to potentially make it out of the rat race and become a partner. Except, there are generally not enough jobs, despite the glut of attorneys and if you don't go to a top school, those opportunities may not be entirely available. If you do make partner, now you have the responsibility of not only running your cases, but also ensuring that your associates are making money for you and not tanking your case. You work weekends, holidays, birthdays, anniversaries - whatever the case and your superiors or your clients demand. There is high pressure on you to deliver the best possible result to your client, even if that result isn't necessarily possible given the circumstances of the case. Your client's problems become your own problems. You take your work home with you and expose your loved ones to the stress of the job.

If this doesn't sound like something you're prepared to do, then I would suggest not going. But, as I have said, there are upsides and I am generally on the very cynical end of the spectrum for attorneys. I tell you guys not to go because most of you shouldn't go. You don't know who you are, what you want in life, and how you are going to align your strategy to achieve those goals. Asking a 21 year-old to go off and make a decision about the next 40-50 years of their life is honestly a very fraught proposition. I tell students to expose themselves to the law - take law classes, talk to University alumni who are lawyers, go work in a law firm, go sit in on law school classes. Do everything you can to prepare yourself for what it will be like and if you like what you are being exposed to, then by all means, go and enroll. Generally, students don't know why they want to be lawyers - they just assume that it's the next step in their education without asking whether they want to do this job for several decades.

In my 2 years of teaching at university, only 1 student has proven to me that they are prepared for this in every way you should be before going. This is out of several hundreds of students that I have had now. So in that way, I suggest you look at some of these things and take them under advisement. If you enjoy your free time, low pressure etc., this is not a job for you, and that is not a bad thing to say or admit. It takes a very specific type of person to do this work and that doesn't mean that that type of person is a good person etc. It just means they are attuned to the type of life this will be. Every single person I have told not to go who went anyway came back to tell me that they regretted it. That's not to say that you don't come to enjoy certain parts of the job. But if you want to last in this business, you have to love it.

I tell students to take a few gap years and go work and learn about themselves. Go see the world. Go work in our government. Go teach English in another country. Go do the things you always wanted to do because once you become a professional - any kind - those opportunities begin to disappear. I have taken a total of 3 vacations in my 6 years as an attorney and I worked during all 3 of them. Go live your life - the law and law school will still be here if you've done all of these things and still want to go. Let me know if you have any other questions.

Am I screwed?,90,ee7nrv,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ee7nrv/verbally_accepted_a_salary_offer_that_i_feel_is/,28,"Hi all. I am an early career engineer (HVAC automation industry). Over the last several months, I have been interviewing for a new position with a different team in my company. This position is desirable because it will carry more responsibilities than my current role, and I feel it has better upward trajectory for my career. I would also be working on projects I care about (energy sustainability). At the risk of sounding dramatic, it’s one of the best professional opportunities I’ve come across. This week I received a phonecall from the hiring manager informing me I had been selected for the position, which is obviously exciting.

I am conflicted because I feel the offer they made for salary is too low for this role. It is a 6% increase from my current salary, when I was hopeful for at least 15%. Admittedly I screwed up negotiations by not broaching the topic during the interviewing process. I was afraid of losing out on an opportunity I wanted by bringing up the topic inappropriately, which I now know was a naive and incorrect (I’m still young and make mistakes) way to look at it. For context, the salary I’ve been offered for the role is similar in value to offers I had at graduation.

The reason that I feel the offer is too low is because of the increased responsibility I cited earlier. My role is currently purely design. This new role would carry sales engineering and project management responsibilities, in addition to design responsibilities. The role will also have me traveling 50-60% of the time to customer sites for field work.

In addition to all of that, changing to this team will require me to move 18 hours away. I will be giving up my girlfriend, my friends, family, professional relationships, and volunteering roles in my current area. I realize these are all personal items, but I feel it is important to note what I would be sacrificing to take this role. 

I’ve been told by the hiring manager and others in my life that “the money will come later,” but to me that feels  hollow. I’ve always been told that the best way to receive larger raises is by changing positions. And at the end of the day, life is not just about the job you work. Right now, part of me feels like I will be making a mistake to give everything up I mentioned just for a job if it’s not the salary I want, even if it is a very desirable role. 

What are everyone’s thoughts? Am I screwed since I verbally accepted (I haven’t signed any contracts)? Is it too late to negotiate? Is the increase actually reasonable, and I am just being entitled? Am I too “in my head,” and just getting cold feet about what is still the right decision? 

I apologize for the length, and potentially rambling nature of this post. I am very stressed and conflicted about this, and am just hopeful for some objective 3rd party perspectives. Thanks in advance to anyone who responds! I hope you all have a great holiday.",1577065082.0,2019-12-22 20:38:02

I’ve posted about this before. I was hired as a social media executive (some events involved too) for a small business, reporting into the marketing director. When hired, she told me she would be going on maternity leave, but assured me it wouldn’t be long at all, she would be on call, and the Big boss would be around to pick up certain aspects of her job (which I have no experience in).

Cut to now, she has gone completely awol and we have found out she won’t be etirning until September, so that’s 7 months off! Bear in mind I’m paid a junior salary ($30,000)

I have been piled with a huge amount of work I have no experience in which is very technical, so have admittedly been struggling. As a result, my boss has been shouting at me for my lack of experience and the fact that he has to help with my job.

The other day on the phone, every time I said ‘ok’ to something, he would scream ‘stop saying ok!!!’ at me. 

When he gives me tasks, he also screams at me to ‘stop writing things down!!!’, as apparently I have to soak things in.

Yesterday, we had a meeting and he said he was going to create a presentation as I have a lot to do (and I have no experience of using the spreadsheet that has all the figures- I was actually told to not touch it). He comes into the office 10 mins before the meeting asking what I have prepared, and shouts at me in front of everyone for not preparing something.

He also screamed at me in front of everyone regarding a retainer contract my marketing director signed, but then proceeded to apologise as it was signed before I started.

This on top of him micromanaging everything I do and calling everything myself and my colleagues do shit, is giving me serious anxiety.

The weirdest thing is that he flips from being awful to very nice, so will take us to a really nice lunch after he shouts.

I’m going to hand in my notice mid-May as I seriously cannot take it anymore. I have plenty of savings so don’t really care if I have nothing lined up. I feel guilty about leaving when she’s on maternity leave, but now realise that is not my problem. 

I am also grieving at the moment (lostva family member to cancer) so it’s a struggle.

I’m quite a sensitive person however so don’t know if I’m overreacting? Would be good to hear your thoughts.

How to avoid burnout?,92,erhsup,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/erhsup/working_2_full_time_jobs_how_to_avoid_burnout/,27,"Long story short, Job#1 barely supplements a livable wage. I also have about 10k worth of debt. I’m learning how to manage money better but I’m at the point where I want to get the hell out of my family home. I figured it would be way better to alleviate the debt first, while also learning to handle my money better, before setting off on the path of independence.

I decided to pick up a second job, and it turns out it’s full time. I was unaware of the schedule because I was getting two different responses from the HR and the manager. So I’ve pretty much doubled my income which is just fine. I’ll be making about 3500 a month, and figured after the monthly bills, I can have the debt paid off in 3-4 months, and another 3-4 months worth of saving for a nest egg once the current lease is up. (I’m on the lease with a parent). My hours are pretty much sun up to sun down (17 hours), roughly 5 hours of sleep in between days. I have no days off, aside from 2 mornings and 2 evenings off (spread across 4 days). I’d like to keep both jobs for at least 6 months, losing the second job is not the end of the world, but it will delay my financial goals considerably. I’m afraid that this mindset will lead me to quit the second job once this motivation inevitably dissipates during times of weakness. So my questions are as follows:

I guess, how do you guys decide what you are going to do in any given day, or in regards to your job. I often find myself thinking that perhaps maybe I should of went to a better school, which would've allowed me better connections. But then I'm reminded I graduated debt free. I wish I took this job offer, so I could gain more valuable experiences, but I stayed behind since I wasn't sure if it was necessarily better for my career. I do this so often. Even clothes. I didn't grow up rich, and we had enough to scrape by. But that mentality and feeling had carried me on. I have nice clothes that I've attained over the years, but I prefer comfy clothes, since I'd rather deal with washing clothes I don't care about, because if I wore nice clothes, I'd feel I waste them. Now I'm not insane, or crazy, I still get out of bed and I'm not depressed. I'm in a good place, I just wonder if things would of turned out differently if I worked harder or maybe lazier, so to speak. I wonder if I maybe left home later how my life might turn out different.

I am unable to keep a job that pays me enough to make a decent living. I had a pretty good paying job at a corporate healthcare technology company as a proposal and marketing communications specialist but I was only able to keep it for 2 months. I took it very seriously. However, as hard as I tried, I was unable to maintain my focus throughout the entire day, no matter how many milligrams of Ritilin I was prescribed. I also had issues with punctuality which ultimately lead this company to fire me last Friday. While I was late to the office just a couple of times, it was more an issue of making sure I was getting to all the meetings on time, and there were probably 10 to 12 meetings each week. The last straw for this company was when I missed an entire meeting because another meeting ran overtime into the next. This is still my fault because I needed to have better time management and communicate to the head of the first meeting that I needed to leave at a certain time in order to make the next one… I am unable to adhere to a rigid corporate schedule or maintain my focus during extra long meetings. 

Anyways, I am very disappointed and I feel like a total fuckup. I think I need a new career path, because I have had these same issues in the past. I also have creative talents that I would like to explore further and see if they translate to something I am better suited for. Please let me know if the community could recommend a decent paying career path that would highlight my skills and incorporate some of the things I am passionate about. I could also be interested in going back to school if necessary, (and if the debt required to do so isn’t too outrageous). Also, does anyone think remote work might be a good option for me?

Hello /r/careerguidance I'm quite possibly experiencing one of the most soul crushing, self worth ruining things of my life, and I could use some advice. I had my first real job as an engineer, and was fired, not for performance, or misconduct, but for reasons which essentially amount to ""poor culture fit"" after a bit under a year. I've been miserable since, but have been applying to jobs religiously, the only problem is, the responses I'm getting are from jobs which represent a 25% pay cut, and are not the same position in the career. I'm unsure of how to proceed. I need a job, and the area in which I'm applying is closer to home which has a significantly lower cost of living than where I relocated for the position I lost, but I don't know if I should accept the first offer that comes in, or if I should wait for one which matches my goals.

Not only that, but I'm extremely embarrassed about being fired, and am having trouble explaining it out loud in phone interviews, essentially its boiling down to ""I left because my energy and ambition did not adequately match that of my group"" (Read: I'm annoying and everyone hates me) or ""I was asked to leave for"" the above reason, if its not asked whether or not I was asked to leave, I don't bring it up, and I'm not sure if that is the right decision.

I'm really lost, I'm really depressed, and I don't know what to do, because at the end of the day, being an engineer was extremely boring, and I didn't like what I was doing, but I'm not really qualified for anything else since I was so early in my career.",1551334337.0,2019-02-28 01:12:17

I am a software developer for a large consulting firm. I was told during the hiring process that it would require up to 50% travel which I am okay with. However, I am currently on a project that requires me to fly 700 miles to the client site 4 days a week every week. I leave my house for the airport every Sunday at noon and return home every Thursday around 10pm. 

I love my job but the traveling but being away from home for the majority of every week is mentally and emotionally draining. This position is perfect for me in every way except for the heavy travel requirements. My current project will be wrapping up soon and I am trying to decide how to approach the topic of traveling less in the future with my manager. 

My boss is a fantastic person and he really cares about his employees. I feel like I could talk to him about this, but I don’t want it to reflect poorly on me or come across as laziness or insubordination. 

How would you suggest approaching this situation?

Now, 8 months later I am the most depressed I’ve ever been, anxiety has completely stripped me of my appetite to the point where I’ve lost 10 pounds in the last two months. Every morning I wake up sick to my stomach because I dread my job. I hate what I do, I don’t care about either industry my job falls in, I am given zero resources from my superiors, with unreasonable expectations. I don’t have a background in this industry. I am so utterly lost. Working home alone stuck to myself all day doesn’t help either.  

For the past two and a half months, the only thought in my brain has been “just quit.” As far as I see it, having no job can’t possibly be worse than this horrible anxiety and depression I feel every day. I don’t have the energy to pursue other work full force, I don’t have the energy to pursue anything creative that would make me happy.  I suppose it would be a bit different if I had officemates to commiserate with, or if I had a partner coming home every night, but the fact is I don’t. I’m stuck in a cycle where I’m afraid that “this is it” for the rest of my life without seeing a way out. And if “this is it” I can be honest and say this is not a life I can survive in much longer.  

I guess what I’m asking is, how irresponsible and stupid would it be to just quit without something solid lined up already? I’ve 7 months of living expenses saved (although I would HATE to deplete my entire savings), and I have a few freelance gigs I’m already working on (nothing that comes remotely close to my current salary, but I wouldn’t go immediately to zero income). 

Quitting would allow me to have the bandwidth to a) search for another secure job I’d be happier with, and b) expand my hustle for freelance work. I guess also c) pursue personal creative things I don’t have time/energy for now.  

I’ve been setting up meeting after meeting after meeting with different companies in my industry, but no one is hiring right now. I’ve learned I have a fabulous reputation, but there just aren’t any openings. But I can’t just wait around. Something in my immediate future needs to change drastically if I’m to keep surviving as I’m just so miserable and unhappy right now.

The company is not big by any means, around 35 employees. There is a general unhappiness, anxiety, overworked, understaffed air about the place and this was even before COVID-19.

The pandemic has of course made things worse. Our salaries have been cut, which is understandable considering the situation but our clients have also lost some of their ability to pay us while we still bust our asses for them. This is what our boss expects, a lot of work and less pay. We have been told we should be grateful we still have jobs, in not as nice terms.

I've had some issues at my current company, but I'm acknowledged as one of its top-performing employees. I have glowing performance reviews, and my interactions with management from my direct supervisor all the way to the COO have all been positive. No one has a bad word to say about me. I've made suggestions for significantly revamping some of the processes in our project management office, and by surprise, some have actually been implemented.

However, I've been unhappy for awhile-- while acknowledged as a high-performing employee, I'm paid the same as coworkers who have not received the same accolades. My job description has expanded tremendously, and I've received the same raises -- in both timing and amount -- as colleagues who do less than I do. I was told I won't be promoted to project manager (the next logical step), but project plans, etc. that I've developed are used as templates by more senior members of our PMO. I'm even responsible for training newly-hired project managers on our processes. As a result, I feel extremely disrespected by most of the office's management team. The workplace is also toxic. New employees rarely last more than three months.

On a whim, I answered a LinkedIn message from a recruiter, and to make a long story short, I now have an offer letter in hand from another company. It's a significant pay increase (more than I'd make at my current job if I was left their pay increase schedule). My job title doesn't change, but I'd also be working in an industry with better long-term growth potential and higher salaries overall.

I'd feel bad for leaving him in a bind, but it doesn't make sense for me to stay if my current company doesn't attempt to show that they value me.

Hoping to take that to $10K/month so if I can make more money he can quit and find something he enjoys but maybe pays a bit less and we'd still be financially secure.

In the meantime we're looking at options for him (or me).  Not interested in dropshipping-Forex or Cryptocurrency but open to hearing suggestions from people that are walking the walk-stuff you're doing now that is actually working to bring in money.

* Research
* Independent work
* Writing reports, formal documents
* Organizing, planning, strategizing
* A slow pace and perfectionism (I'd rather do one big project well than speed through a dozen small ones)
* Working with my hands
* Living in a big city (I hear library jobs are tough to find unless you're willing to move)

**I don't like...**

* Lots of interpersonal interaction
* More than 75% of my day spent on the computer (I'm flexible on this, but things like programming and graphic design aren't for me)

* Travel
* Long hours
* Math, other than marketing analytics

I work with three people. One was hired right after me. Over the last three months, I've been told I've been doing a great job, but still have a ways to go (obviously after only being there three months). We had a staff admin meeting to discuss who was doing what and who was going to do what.

Before, the higher-lever work went to the two more senior admins (80%) with my providing assistance to them (20%) and the other person is still training. Now, the higher-level work were to be divided among my three coworkers and I am odd man out. Instead, my role is literally doing the grunt work. Instead of doing account management, I'm now responsible for grunt work like cleaning out the fridge on Friday and keeping the copier room tidy. I never felt so insulted and hurt. I have and can do more challenging work and am not sure why or how this was decided. It was a conversation I was left out of. I believe our bosses asked the senior admins for their input because they told me to be prepared to doing some grunt AND accounting work. One of the senior admin said that the new alignment would leave her overwhelmed and asked if some of it could be taken off her plate. She was quickly shut down instead of giving some of it to me. I didn't speak up because they would have shut me down too. No need to look stupid in addition to feeling upset.

I have so much more to offer and have proven it. I know I have not made as big mistakes as the senior admins did after their first three months. The head boss mentioned that if someone is screwing up all the time then you're not going to be giving this higher-level work and I couldn't tell if he was directing that comment to me. No one has said anything to me about any major and consistent mistakes on my end. Not one person. Even in the meeting they mentioned some of our shortfalls and mine were minor like missing a call as compared to my coworkers' mistakes literally costing the firm money. I was going to ask them if something happened to make them feel like that I can only do grunt work last night and I didn't because I was too upset.

I keep on telling myself that it's not like I'm going to be paid less to make coffee and won't need to stay late doing paperwork anymore. My sense is that people will start to ask why is I am being paid what I am being paid to make coffee and/or I'm too stupid/unwilling/lazy to do anything else. I will ask my boss and her boss on Monday.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I am not young. I am actually older than my co-workers.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Yes, there is some type of disconnect and I believe that it's because one or both of the senior admins are speaking on my behalf to our supervisors. One in particular. I started to cut that person off because I know I cannot trust her, but I was told that cutting people off at work would backfire by the other admin. The other two admins have made serious and costly mistakes when they first started and even recently (which was the reason why we had the meeting to begin with). Those mistakes were brought to their attention formally (closed door meetings with supervisors) as well as plans to prevent them from repeating those mistakes. I, on the other hand, have never had one of those ""closed door"" meetings. There were times when they mentioned to me casually ""hey, next time you take a message from XYZ make sure you ask them for both their cell and home phone"" or ""next time review the bill to see if anything on it looks off."" So when they're talking about people screwing up and being left out of challenging work, I cannot figure out if it's directed at me or to all of us. This troubles me because it can be inferred that they might taking the approach that I'm not worth fixing.

&#x200B;

Finally, I've had blunt conversations with my boss and her boss. I explained to them my anxiety and they assured me that I was doing fine, I am being way too hard on myself and (repeatedly, might I add) that if someone is going to be fired, then they would know it. They stressed to me they try to fix the problem(s) and I see that with current and past employees. They've mentioned that A LOT.

&#x200B;

TBH, I believe that people are right when they say I am not promoting myself enough. I also believe that I might have gotten blamed for things that I wasn't to blame for and am not aware of it and one of my co-workers needs to be cut off. Come Monday morning, I am going to be the first person in the office and speak to my boss and squarely ask her where do I stand and ask her how the choice/justification/logic was made to switch things up and even ask for some of the high-level work back. That is all I can do and keep my mouth shut.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I have no intention to quit. I've had a few other jobs and this is still the best job that I've ever had. I am literally making $8 more dollars an hour, pay $0 for my benefits, close to home and the people are generally nice. It's stable, beautiful offices and I am grateful to be there. That is why it bothers me so much - because I do care about my job. I know the grass isn't going to be NOT on the other side. That is why I am willing to fight to make this work.",1574538653.0,2019-11-23 14:50:53

Reddit, I need some advice.

&#x200B;

I got fired today for excessive tardiness. I won't go into details but suffice it to say that I was in my position for several years, and after today I've realized that I was very much in a ""don't give a shit"" kind of place, mentally. I fully acknowledge I was fired for valid reasons and have no beef with my former employer, this was entirely on me (INB4 ""maybe you should just show up to work on time"" - yup, I know, and this will definitely be my primary focus as far as personal development goes).

&#x200B;

I held a corporate-level, senior SME/admin role, and I possess an extremely high level of knowledge and experience in a fairly niche field. I'm currently looking at some positions that could offer as much as a 50% pay increase from what I was making, in a similar or almost identical role, so obviously I was being underpaid - which I kind of knew already, and is probably the biggest factor in that ""don't give a shit"" attitude I had. I totally acknowledge that just getting lazy and not caring, rather than seeking a new opportunity, is totally my fault. But, now that I'm having this come-to-Jesus moment, I'm not sure how to proceed with future opportunities. Do I tell them I was fired for tardiness? Is it acceptable to decline discussing the reasons I left the company? How would this affect my chances for landing a new position, or salary/benefit negotiations? I appreciate any and all advice, insight, anecdotes, etc. If you have questions I'll try to respond as best I can. Thanks in advance.",1561184300.0,2019-06-22 02:18:20

Currently I (37m) work a very high paying tech job that allows me to work remotely. I work from home in NYC. I own a house and live with my wife and 2 small kids. There is an in-law unit in the house where my sister and brother in law live. I make my own hours, I have full control over the work I need to do, and I do it well. I grew up in the east coast, I have a good amount of friends and family here, generally speaking life is pretty chill.
That said, I have hit the ceiling on my career. There is no room to advance and at this point it's not all that exciting. Working from home these past 7 years has felt pretty isolating. I miss the workplace community and interactions.
Now I have a job offer at a company in Seattle. It's a Sr position doing what I do now. It would be in the office every day with big expectations to solve some big problems. The total compensation is around the same as my current employer, but the catch is most of it is in salary, where as my current employer it is split between stock and salary. It's a great opportunity to work from an office again and take my career to the next level.
But I am really torn about this decision. Moving and starting anew in a city I don't have a lot of connection to. My wife has a bunch of family in Portland, so that's nice, but I will be moving away from my family. Working from the office means I will have less flexibility in my schedule.
I just don't know what to do. It seems like a great career move, but am I foolish for giving up a pretty easy life for this opportunity. Am I foolish for even thinking about moving away from my friends and family. Nothing is permanent, and we could always leave in a year or two if we aren't loving it.

It's a small team (3 of us) so there's really no room for upward mobility at this organization; plus, I'm feeling ready to move on, anyway. Most of the job postings I'm interested in are communications/writing/project management/managing editor-type roles. 

The problem is, I'm a rather quiet, introverted person (but not shy). I tend to need a good bit of time and space to think things through and strategize. I enjoy talking to people one-on-one. I can do presentations and structured discussions well. But drop me in a group dinner where everyone is casually conversing and I get stuck in my head thinking about everything that everyone is saying and before long just want to go back to my hotel room and knit. However, I'm apparently pretty good at projecting confidence. On a recent work trip, my supervisor (who I don't work closely with at all) told me, ""You don't really strike me as the type of person who gets stressed out about things."" Which I found surprising and hilarious because that's pretty far from the truth.

Most of the jobs I'm interested in that have room to grow and reach higher, managerial roles require a lot of people skills. And I'm just kind of...awkward.

I was diagnosed with autism at 42, and with ADHD at 43. Since entering treatment, my health has improved dramatically, and I'm now in a position to work towards things that I thought could only be dreams.

This poses a bit of a problem, since I have no idea what I want to do - or rather, I desperately wanted to study a language and then translate, but my home situation makes that difficult. I know that I want to go to university, but I have to decide what to study once I'm there, and what sort of work I not only want to do, but *will be able* to do. I'm educated to UK A-level standard, and am doing preparatory college courses to get me to the point I'm confident in my ability to tackle a degree.

I'm focused, driven and meticulous. I'm a problem-solver. I love data and detail. I love complex structures. I love puzzling out difficult things. I love going deep into one small field for years. I argue a lot, and I write well. I read very fast, and I'm a good researcher. I read Acts of Parliament and draw graphs for fun. I like numbers and logic. I do basic coding in around ten languages, and I use this constantly to fix problems around me. I do Japanese fan translations. ***I'm a learner*** - I love to study. Even at my worst, I've always worked to be better.

But I also have serious issues around my health. I can't do hard physical labour. I can't work routine long hours. I can work with people, but I'd need longer periods of working by myself. I put myself across well in writing, but in speech I come across as confused and inarticulate; I don't deal well with people. I have issues with memory and attention that make me prone to constant errors. I don't want to spend too much time in front of a computer, because it detaches me from the world that I need to be *in*, if I'm ever to accomplish anything in any job. I'd like to be able to work from home some of the time, but not all of the time.

I know I want to get a degree, just because it rankles that I've been to uni twice and don't have one. But I'm afraid that I'll take the risks, lose a lot, and still be unemployable at the end of it. I'll be in my 50s by the time I'm looking for work, an age when most people are terrified of losing their jobs because they'll never be rehired. And I don't know what my disability issues will look like in five years. I hope many will improve, but I would be a fool to think that many won't.

So I was wondering if there's ANY decent careers she might be able to pursue that'd be cheap and that could possibly work with her schedule? I know it's a long shot, I'm just desperate for her. She's always wanted to be a vet since she loves animals (more than anybody I know), she loves learning about crime, is really into medical stuff, loves helping children and the mentally disabled (since her nephew has autism), and even loves tattooing (she was a tattoo teacher at a VoTech school before the arthritis.) She dropped out of college and always says if she had the chance again she'd finish it. So I just want her to have that chance. Any answer is helpful, she'd love any job that paid decently where she didn't have to work 24/7.",1558669184.0,2019-05-23 23:39:44

Here are the details:

Been at my current job 7 years. I'm 29. Started at the lowest rung now I'm in inside sales. Not only do I do all inside sales jobs functions as everyone else, but I also have about 8 other duties.

I do not see a pay raise nor a promotion in the near future. Shit, I haven't seen a pay raise in the 3 or 4 years I've been in this position. I tAlked to management about this and had a document typed up with everything I've done and taken on. How much money I've saved and how much wasted time has been saved... This triggered them to give not only me, but my full group a cost of living raise. This is all I've seen in the last 3 or 4 years. I was pissed because I specifically went to them about why I am worth more... We're all paid equally but they have one job where I have about eight. Not only that but I HAVE RUN 3 DEPARTMENTS AT ONCE INBETWEEN HIRES. They just keep piling more and more ""projects"" on me, that adds to my full time duties. 

Now that's the bad...here is the good:

I'm salary. I have 3 weeks vacation. Never work overtime. I live 10 minutes from the office. As long I work my 8 a day I can come and go whenever. Get here at 7, no lunch and leave at 3? Cool. Get here at 8, take a lunch and leave at 5? Cool. You get it. If I need to just leave, no problem. Cool people too. 

Here's the big one they hold over your head...it's employee owned. In the 7 years I've been here I own more than $90k in stocks....without putting a penny into it. I also have my 401k which they do not contribute to.

Anyway, sorry for the bit of a rant. 

Am I just feeling entitled? What would you do in this situation? I've pretty much given up on fighting for a raise. I've plead my case with clear numbers and research...its just not gonna happen. 

As much as I want to search for another job, I'm worried the grass will not be greener.

I get along with everyone but I’m not an extroverted person, and can’t play the office politics game very well. 

There is a girl who started the same year I did who already has a lead position by basically having the social skills to impress the director. She has the same education I do and one less certification than me. She is not respected by coworkers and people have to pick up her slack. How do people just *know* how to work the politics of a job?! 

I am craving more responsibility and don’t want to break into another industry and have to start over in my career. What bachelors degree would be best for me to obtain? I am considering an online healthcare management program. Are there are any other similar degrees that would be beneficial to advancing my career and augment my existing experience?

Right now none of the higher ups have advanced degrees. It’s like a big social club in management and they all moved up the ladder before degrees made much of a difference. Another concern I have is I am 26. What advice does anyone have for a young-ish person looking to break into administration?

This was supposed to be temporary for a maximum of two-three months. However, it's close to four months now and no updates on the relocation. I'm getting very frustrated with remote working because it's not at all what I signed up. The HR and my manager (who's otherwise a pretty decent fellow) are beating around the bush without giving me clear answers. And there's rumors that there's no relocation budget left.
I very strongly want to start looking for other jobs. But I find myself looking at ads with almost the same job description as my current job and I feel like I wouldn't be able to justify why I want to move without ratting out my employer. 
Should I stick around for longer? Or should I start looking and be honest during interviews?

TLDR- Is remote to non-remote movement an acceptable reason to look for a job change when you've just started a new remote job (which wasn't disclosed to be remote at the time of hiring) ?",1577866280.0,2020-01-01 03:11:20

My passion is scuba diving and I love the ocean environment. I also would like to make a series documentaries around diving, similar to BBC’s blue planet but more Centers around diving.

What I’m doing now and what I don’t like about it: I’m currently working for my dad in construction, I’m a labourer on £8.50 per hour, terrible money for the graft imo, it’s very tedious and I hate manual labour. I really hate the people I work with too, except for a minute few, they’re vulgar and extremely close-minded people. It’s a stressful and frustrating environment.

Now I’m not going to sugarcoat the fact that I was a spoiled kid, which I’m not blaming anyone for, my parents had a poor upbringing and didn’t want they’re children to experience the same lifestyle. So, it’s bittersweet, it definitely hasn’t helped me acclimatise to the “real world”.

I’m blabbing now but essentially I just want to earn a nice income, be independent and work with my passion. 

I’ve looked into marine biology and commercial diving, none quite fit the picture. Can anyone give me some advice on how to move forward?
It’s been 3 years and I’m in the same place as I was when I was in school. Thanks Reddit.

Tl;dr - I want a job in scuba diving, that pays well and I’m self employed (ideally). I can’t stand construction anymore.

I'm now 40 years old and I don't have a career in any single field.  I have multiple degrees in film and media.  I love stories and I love making people laugh.  I've worked in the film industry (couldn't stand it because my personality doesn't fit the ego and status driven culture), a small business in trading (I liked the autonomy but had no passion for selling merchandise), teaching (love working with children and I'm great at it but it gets exhausting), government (struggled with the bureaucracy but enjoyed the easy pace), animation production (being a small cog in a giant system made me depressed).  

I'm smart and hard-working so I generally succeed in whatever I do.  But I find that I always get tired of a job after a year or two and move on to something different.  I recently quit my animation job and thought that I wanted to pursue stand-up comedy professionally.  I do have a knack for it: performing, writing and comedy.  But after a few months of performing as an amateur, I now think this is something I'd like to pursue as a hobby and not an occupation.  

I recently took a Jackson Vocational Interest Survey and my top 3 interests are 1. social science, 2. professional advising and 3. performing arts.  

I'm now thinking that I'd like to work for a non-profit that helps youths.  I've always found it fulfilling to help youths to develop themselves and achieve their goals (mainly because this is what I wish I had when I was younger.) I'm hoping that if I pursue this line of work for income and pursue stand-up as a hobby that I'll be fulfilled spiritually, financially and creatively.  But I'm scared that even this I'll get tired of after a year or two and end up where I am now.

Are there other people like me?  Is my problem that I just haven't found a line of work that works for me - the assumption being that there is a ""right fit"" for everyone?  Or are there personalities that just gets bored easily and needs change every few years?  If so, what is the best way to deal with this type of problem?

It took me six years to graduate with that degree (including one year that I was academically dismissed and later reinstated)

I struggled mightily the entire time.

My first two years, I keep failing and repeating classes just to get by.

My third year, I was academically dismissed from my university.

I returned the fourth year and decided that I am going to live and breath chemistry and nothing else.

I woke up, eat breakfast, and study chemistry. Then I go to classes and study chemistry between classes. (I eat lunch while studying.) After that, I eat dinner and go to bed. Rinse and repeat.

When I said ""study"", I mean 80% reading (textbook, online papers from the professors, etc.) and 20% doing homework, lab report, etc.

Reading is just so time and energy consuming. I have to spend so much effort making sure that I am reading the right words that I often get ""lost"" in the text and forget what the text was saying.

I wasn't just my chemistry major classes that I was struggling with. I struggled with the general elective classes (literature, ethnic study, etc.)

My advisers sent me to skill classes (note taking classes, time management classes, etc) and they didn't help.

Finally, in my last term, I talked with my professor in a class I was struggling with.

I describe extensively how hard I try and how much time I spend studying. What he said changed my life.

He said that I probably have dyslexia and that his son has that.

I changed the way I study. I stopped retyping my notes after class, and instead, record lectures for later listening. Instead of reading texts, I use text to speech software to listen to text.

I initially thought that I would surely fail that class. I, instead, ended up with a B+.

In another class, I earned my first ever A+ in college.

Furthermore, with the change in the way I study, I feel that I didn't have to work as hard to earn a good grade. I was able to retain the material more easily and naturally.

It's a shame that I didn't figured this out earlier. (When I was using the more traditional methods taught in skill classes, I did poorly).

My undergraduate studies are over and I feel that my grades are not reflective of my abilities.

I have a few questions about how different companies set salaries and give raises and promotions. I'm keeping this as brief as possible, but am happy to add more color if needed.

1) Hiring Managers: how would you characterize your salary setting philosophy? Meaning, how much weight to you place on a new hire's individual skills & strengths vs their ""paper"" resume (their degree, their industry experience etc). Also, does this change when related to internal candidates where the candidate may have a great track record within the company and very concrete proven skills demonstrated during their employment thus far, but a weaker paper resume and less industry experience? 

2) Salary increases: I'll give an example here. I had two hires for the same position. I hired one in at a higher salary rate due to prior experience and a very strong resume, but the 2nd (more entry level in the industry, originally hired at a lower rate) is fantastic and quickly outpaced the more experienced hire.  Over 1+ year this employee has proven to be more productive, self driven and innovative, and has also taken on a bigger workload. I want to increase this 2nd hire's salary to be more comparable to the more experienced employee, but am getting pushback because this more entry level employee still technically has less experience. Is this normal? Or, as the hiring manager for this position, should I be pushing harder for a raise for this employee? Assume budget isn't a limiting factor here. 

3) Internal Promotions: I've seen my current company manage internal promotions in two different ways,  and I'm curious which is more common practice (or if both are used commonly, or something else)

Lets say a current employee proves their skills & worth and is clearly ready for a promotion. There is a larger role needed,  and the employee is a good fit for growth. Assume budget isn't the issue here, just employee development. Do you....

A) Offer the employee the additional responsibilities and a title change, as well as a salary bump.

B) Give the employee the additional responsibilities. If they do well, offer them the title change and salary bump after they prove they can do the new job. 

C) Another option? Post the new job and do a formal hiring process? Anything else? 

Tldr: paper resume or proven skills, which has more impact on an employee's salary? ",1545103048.0,2018-12-17 22:17:28

I've been with this non profit organization for the last 2 years. I started as an Office Assistant but took on more duties that involved help in the administrative team. My duties evolved to the point that they decided to create a new title for me: Operations Specialist. This involves, IT support, systems management, Contact Resource Management, training new-hires, new hire paperwork, creating flyers and promotional materials for events, direct supervision of office assistant, compiling and reporting on data to our funders and contractors etc.

Today:

I was told this morning that they are going to move our current Office Manager to a different position and have me absorb her duties and her title. This means that, in addition to (most of) my current duties, I will be doing payroll, assisting in human resources, accounts payable, direct support for management, overseeing office supply inventory, answering all incoming phone calls, overseeing our incoming and outgoing mail, responding to our info@ emails, and be the contact person for all office staff for sick days and time off requests.

I asked what the new pay was going to be. I was told that I am already in the middle range of the new position so she wouldn't consider a pay raise discussion until 3 months. I asked if she would be flexible on that at all and was told that it's not in the budget at the moment and, because I will have to learn quickbooks, I don't have all of the job skills required yet anyway.

I asked what would happen if I decide the new position is not for me. I was told "" If you decided that it wasn't for you then I guess you are resigning.  We don't have any other positions open. ""

I have two questions: Can I get unemployment if I don't want the job? Have they done something wrong to me? I can't really figure it out. All I know is that I feel really hurt and don't feel like working here any more but can't seem to work out what specifically is making me feel that way.

When I sent my resume for a drafter position I was very clear I had completed x credits in the architecture program in my home country, never said I had graduated. However, all my coworkers think I am an architect. I am doing very good here, I started with a low salary but now I make more money than all of them that are actual architects. I didn't do anything wrong, I never lied about it, they got it wrong for some reason. However, I did have the opportunity to correct them last time a new employee was being introduced to us and they said ""everyone in this row are architects"", but I didn't say anything. What should I do?

ps: by ""architect"" I mean bachelor in Architecture, not a licensed Architect.

**UPDATE**: Probably I wasn't clear enough or I shouldn't have used the term ""architect"". Here in the office, we all know that there is only one person who is the licensed architect. He is the one signing and stamping all architectural projects.

However, it's a common practice when introducing someone to call them ""architect"" or ""engineer"" even though they are not licensed. When referring to the licensed professional, we say ""he is the licensed architect"". I know this is technically wrong, but this is not the point here.

The point is that they think I am a bachelor in Architecture but I am not and now after two years I feel very uncomfortable having to explain them I didn't finish architectural school.",1576107753.0,2019-12-11 18:42:33
973,Lost 39 year old looking for career advice (having never participated in the job market)?,79,dxnikc,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/dxnikc/lost_39_year_old_looking_for_career_advice_having/,33,"Hello,

I am at a crossroads in my life and feel pretty lost and deflated. I know nothing about starting a career and finding a job and I while I work myself into the matter, I am looking to you guys to maybe lend a helping hand.

I am a 39 year old lawyer living in Berlin, Germany. After graduating I worked as a self-employed lawyer for 2 years, realized I hated it and became a daytrader (for the last 2-3 years) hoping to achieve financial independence - this did not work out. I am now looking for a job to make a living and to be able to support my girlfriend and newborn son.

My days of self-actualization are over, pragmatism is the name of the game for me and I am willing to accept any sustainable compromise that brings in a paycheck.

Any insight from people familiar with the german job market will probably the most valuable, but I am sure some stuff is relatable across borders.

Problem is: I have no work experience and I am really old and my academical achievements are bad (bottom 10% bad).

A bit about myself and my interests: 

I studied philosophy, psychology and politics before swithching to law. This is where my interests mainly lie. Geostrategical stuff being the most applicable probably.

I am not very durable and stress-resistant. Any really horrible and draining jobs I can do for maybe 1-2 years, but no longer. I hope for a ""normal"" job, where the good and the bad even itself out and I can bear that for hopefully 5-10 years.

At the moment I think I should start to apply for everything I am remotely qualified for, even when chances are close to non-existent, starting with the jobs I like most and working myself down. I assume the search will take months, so stuff will pop up during my struggle.

The jobs I came up with myself are in order of attractiveness:

Jobs in the political field. I can only think of assistant to some elected politician of any level. 

Maybe political consultancy - but I do not think I am qualified for those.

Maybe some NGO, but I lack any commitment in volunteer work, internships etc., so I can not stand out.

Jobs in administration, probably municipal most likely, but I may be simply to old for that.

Lector for a scientific or academical publisher in law or financial.

Jobs in cultural institutions: assistant or some alw-realted stuff in theaters, museums and the like.

Legal custodian.

All assistant jobs in companies and public law institutions.

Do you guys have any further ideas or can give hints how I might improve my chances with the above jobs? Basically I am looking for jobs that pay well and do not require strong academical achievements.

I am also looking for help how to effectively find jobs and how to streamline my online profiles.

I think I found enough material on CV, cover letters and interviews - but if you guys have the ultimate guide, do not be shy, it is appreciated.

Thank you all very much!

I went from making minimum wage to 35k a year in less than a year, so I'm proud of how far I've come. People are starting to recognize my ability to learn and that feels good.

That being said, the job I'm at now cannot be forever. It's within the tourism industry which is not a stable or recession resistant industry. I also know (and this has taken a lot of work to come to this conclusion) I am able of mind for much more difficult and high paying work in speciality fields.

However, by the time I finish a degree I would be at least 32. That's optimistic. I would be in debt and be 10 years behind my cohorts. I know I'll never have as successful a life as others, but what can I do to use what gifts I do have to capitalize on the time I do have?

I think my interpersonal skills when one on one or in a small group are ok, but I am deathly terrified of public speaking, or even speaking up in a medium sized meeting. Anytime I have to give a presentation, introduce myself publicly in front of a large group of people, or something similar, my heart begins to race and I have a panic attack where I'm short of breath and my voice is shaky. It's embarrassing because I don't have any mental anxiety about these situations, but its entirely physical and I have no control over it. It's like muscle memory.

&#x200B;

I have had a prescription for beta blockers which have been an absolute miracle and basically gotten rid of any anxiety symptoms when in these situations. I will still use them during major presentations, but I don't want to feel reliant on them, and would prefer to go through some sort or training that can rewire my brain into not becoming stressed in these situations. I'm about to graduate college and begin a great job in a major city in which I will often have to give presentations to clients, and I will be surrounded by a lot of type A corporate individuals. 

&#x200B;

At this point it's absolutely essential that I get over this and am able to assimilate into my new job seamlessly. Would joining a Toastmasters club or Dale Carnegie help? I figure that practice is what will help me get over it, by teaching my brain to become less stressed in these situations. Unfortunately, I am unable to take a public speaking course at my university. I checked a local community college, but was confused if I was able to enroll not being a student, and if what I found was even a legitimate course. I believe this form of social anxiety I have is probably my biggest weakness and a major barrier that once its overcome, will allow me to thrive professionally.

&#x200B;

Any advice, tips, or similar experiences that can be shared would be appreciated. I begin my new job this summer, and I feel like the longer I go without fixing this, the harder it will be to do so.",1550557527.0,2019-02-19 01:25:27

I have about $100k in student loans that I am already aggressively paying down, but getting to a net worth of $0 is going to take about 3 years. 

In every job I've had (1 consulting, 2 finance), I probably have 1-2 hours of real work to do each day but I am expected to keep the chair warm from 9 to 6. My team doesn't work in the same city as me, so I don't really understand why I need to be in the office. I've tried to create my own projects in every job, but (1) we are a regulatory function and there isn't much to add; and (2) I'm there to complete work that needs done, not dream up time-wasting projects to look busy with. 

The people in my office are on other teams so we don't have anything to talk about. They are also in very different life stages than me. We say hi but that's about it.

The usual advice in this situation seems to be ""use that free time to study for your next job."" Well I have been studying for the past 3 years post-grad, and that's exactly how I got this job. It's just going to get me into a different variant of this situation. Let me know which jobs don't require 9-6 desk sitting for statistical modelers and I'll definitely start studying.

I don't want to sit at a desk doing nothing all day. It's pointless, unhealthy, and rather lonely. My reviews are positive as when there is work, I do it quickly and with good quality. There just isn't enough work. 

This results in me trying to look busy all day when I'm really staring into space. I don't want another job in my field because they are all the like this (I'm on my 3rd one now) and I don't want to switch fields because I'd likely end up in the same situation for a lot less pay. 

**I want to work but there doesn't seem to be any worthwhile work to be done.** I am a bored, soulless desk sitter waiting for 6. 

EDIT: I can't work remotely. It is discouraged on my team and in my field. Ironic, because we are geographically dispersed, so we are all technically remote, we just have to sit in the office and listen to that guy Steve's fucking theories about who's making it to the playoffs and his cell phone arguments with his wife.

A few weeks ago, it was mentioned that executives and director-level employees may be forced to take a pay cut to keep the company afloat. However, today it was announced that all employees will see a 20% pay cut starting in a few weeks.

I am currently one of the lowest paid employees in the company and absolutely will not be able to afford the cost of living in my area if my salary is reduced by 20%. I met with my boss to ask whether the exec team could consider a lower percentage cut (like 10 or 15%) for employees making below a certain salary/seniority level. The company is small, so there are only a handful of associate level employees to whom this exception would apply. He was pretty negative towards the idea saying that it’s “tough for everyone right now” and that it’s “only fair” for everyone to make the same sacrifice.

But the thing is... we’re not really all making the same sacrifice. While I am grateful to have a job during this situation, a 20% cut for my boss and other senior level employees is probably a “sacrifice.” On the other hand, a 20% reduction for those of us at the bottom is a make or break difference. Honestly, when the office reopens, Im not even sure if I’d be able to afford the cost of my commute anymore on this reduced salary. It would almost have been better to be laid off or furloughed because currently, unemployment pays more than my reduced salary, plus, I’d be eligible for other benefits, like food stamps and subsidized rent. At the very least, offering a reduction in hours along side the salary decrease would allow me the ability to take on a second job (if I can find one...)

My boss told me I could bring it up with HR, but that they “most likely won’t be receptive.” I understand that things are tough and I am willing to sacrifice in order to keep my job (such as giving up other benefits like the paid leave I’ve acquired) ... but I need to at least try to negotiate a better situation because, quite frankly, I can’t afford not to.

I am 25 and have been working as a digital designer for 3 years in advertising and design firms. I am looking for a complete career change but don’t know where to begin. I'm feeling pretty lost and getting anxious and overwhelmed.

In my 3 years working as a designer I have grown to find the work unrewarding, meaningless, and not stimulating. Gradually my dissatisfaction with my career has lead me into an existential crisis and depression.

I have decided that I no longer want a desk/ office job that requires you to work on the computer majority of the day as I find it is not stimulating for me. I hate sitting in the same office behind a screen every day.

I want to find a non-desk job that is meaningful and rewarding. Something that I can be passionate about and feel good for contributing to the greater good of the world. Something that has good career trajectory - good potential to progress in my career and earn more as I get older. I would love to be working outdoors some of the time or at least moving around, not sitting at a desk.

I am particularly interested in the idea of doing environmental work of some sort - maybe forestry or wildlife conservation. I would also consider humanitarian or even social work.

I have a Bachelor of Design and would be willing to do further studies for up to 2 years to make me qualified for my dream job, whatever it may be.

The hard part is that I have not done maths or science further than junior high school so I can’t get into a Masters Degree that has prerequisites of maths and science.

I have considered carpentry and other trades, but I think I want to find something more meaningful that is having a positive impact rather than just just building houses or commercial buildings. Although, I think I would like to be working with my hands or doing technical work of some sort.

I have also considered fireman and paramedic jobs but I don’t think I would cope well with the stress and traumatic situations they have to deal with.

I have been looking for quite a while at possible career options or further studies but I am really stumped for answers. 

I struggle with anxiety and I am getting quite overwhelmed when searching and not seeming to make much progress so that is why thought I would try posting here to see what suggestions people have.

Does anyone out there have any ideas of cool jobs that I could look into or further studies that I could do to help me in the right direction?

Or has anyone gone through a similar experience with wanting a complete career change, to ditch their desk job and find something more fulfilling?

&#x200B;

If you have any suggestions at all, please throw them down. I just want to get as many ideas as possible.  


Thanks :)",1542561424.0,2018-11-18 12:17:04

996,"Company refuses to promote worthy people, forces them out, then advertises their job at higher grade. Why?",74,binfaf,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/binfaf/company_refuses_to_promote_worthy_people_forces/,21,"I work for a large engineering firm in the UK.

The company has a culture whereby effective, valuable and worthy candidates for promotion can spend months - or even years - operating at the level of the grade above, but simultaneously being denied a promotion.

The usual outcome to this is that the employee in question gets fed up and either moves role internally or leaves the business, after which the company invariably re-advertises their position **at the higher grade anyway**.

I have been with the company for 8 years now and have seen this happen time and time and time again. 

The obvious explanation is that the personnel asking for promotion are effectively ""dead wood"", and the managers are happy to see the back of them, or that they feel it is an opportunity to bring in outside talent. However, this is not the case. The ones being pushed to leave are often the hardest working and most ambitious, and usually have very niche and specialised knowledge/experience. The ""dead wood"", by comparison, seem to know they are on to a good thing and try not to rock the boat.

Is this common practice in other businesses? What is the justification behind this kind of approach to personnel management?",1556558414.0,2019-04-29 13:20:14

998,Jobs for someone with brain damage and memory loss?,74,ju2zqe,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ju2zqe/jobs_for_someone_with_brain_damage_and_memory_loss/,19,"Hey, not sure where to post this as it's specific but I thought here might be the best bet.

So my sister unfortunately was diagnosed with Encephalitis whilst at Uni, and the Doctors she had misdiagnosed her and it has unfortunately resulted in her having brain damage. She really struggles with memory, and went from being really good at maths to struggling to remember how to do certain calculations. She used to work in a trade floor before Uni, and it's unfortunately looking like she won't be able to go back there even if she does finish Uni (which she's really struggling with now sadly). She is doing an economics degree. She can still speak/write etc as far as I am aware, it's just her memory that is effected. 

So I'm wondering what kind of job opportunities and career paths she might still have? It's really devastating that this has happened to her, and I'm upset because it seems like it's going to close the door on her dreams. It's been effecting her mood and making her depressed, so I want to try and see what I can do to shed some light into her future. I work in IT myself and I've been trying to research if there's anything she might be able to do there too? She did go through a phase where she was interested in computer programming before the encephalitis.

If anyone is also able to point me in the direction of any specialist subreddits that can help, I'd really appreciate it.

EDIT: thank you so much for your replies everyone, the outpouring of support and guidance is really heart warming and makes me hopeful for her opportunities!",1605393992.0,2020-11-14 17:46:32

You think you have it all figured out and then boom your industry implodes and jobs are scarce. So now the world should be my oyster right?! Wronnnngggg! I have the ability now to make a career change and fear is not helping me choose. When the path seemed so straightforward I was happy, although I didn’t feel I was working in a job that was my passion. Now I’m miserable and have no clue how to pick what’s next. I’m so jealous of people who “do what they love” how in the hell did you figure it out?!",1596769941.0,2020-08-06 23:12:21
