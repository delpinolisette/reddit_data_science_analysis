0,So real talk. Why are so may $30k to $40k per year jobs requiring a bachelors degree?,12259,9u3fww,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9u3fww/so_real_talk_why_are_so_may_30k_to_40k_per_year/,3975,"It just seems odd that when I go on job boards to look at the hiring companies that most entry level (right out of college) jobs I see (client servicing, account management, misc office jobs, etc.) paying around $30k to $40k per year require a 4 year degree. So you're telling me I have to pay $50k to $200k to get a college education so I can make a miniscule income? Well it's no wonder why people cant pay back their student loans.

**Original Post:**

There was a recent post on Reddit where someone was lamenting that they had sent out dozens of applications, but hadn't heard back from anyone. I commented and told them they probably had a bad resume format and to PM me with it so I could review it for them, and about 50 other redditors ended up sending me their resumes to review. I don't have time to do all of them, so I decided to write this post and share a [downloadable editable Word doc resume format](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/2461/6249/files/Sheets_Giggles_Resume_Template_3f2d35d0-b240-4975-88de-9ce2e1e8fccc.docx?v=1586136809) in the hope that it fulfills my personal obligations (*note: delete the footer before sending out!*). Here's a [preview](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y5sHcAI) of the resume.

I'll keep it short and sweet, and hopefully many of you find this useful.

**General resume advice:**

* Use a professional-looking gmail, outlook, or personal domain email address. Delete your hotmail with extreme prejudice.

* Don't put an objective section or summary. It'll be skipped, and it's space that can be used better.

* Unless you have 20+ years' experience, make it 1 page. You can do it.

* Don't put your full address. ""City, State"" is enough.

* Name your resume ""​FirstName LastName Resume"" and that's it. Never submit it with ""(Project Management)"" or ""Final"" or ""2018"" or literally anything else in the file name.

* If emailing your resume, always submit it as a PDF, never as a Word doc. You never know how wonky a Word doc will look on someone else's machine. If uploading to an online application that uses resume parsing software, you can upload the Word doc as well or if it's required to do so.

* Try to read it in 10 seconds or less and see what you take away from it. That's about the initial screen time before someone makes an initial up/down decision, so you'll want to examine it from that perspective.

* Interests are important because it gives the interviewer something to connect with you on, and it makes you more than just a faceless resume. If you put Seinfeld, I promise someone will ask you what your favorite episode of Seinfeld is (mine's the Soup Nazi).

That's the most important stuff.

2,A Warning About Glassdoor,5697,jbod57,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jbod57/a_warning_about_glassdoor/,470,"**EDIT**: A little info from Glassdoor that I learned as part of my last job in marketing:

The most recent review left, regardless of its score, is weighted at 80%. This is why after a negative review is left, a company will routinely leave an onslaught of positive reviews to counterweight the negative one. Glassdoor is trash.

Also, some valuable nomenclature: an [*Active*](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/5-things-can-free-employer-account/) employer is one that uses the platform to respond to reviews and maybe some other trivial touchpoint engagement. An *Engaged* employer may be one that pays for the service. I'm inferring from the subtle threat in Glassdoor's own [content](https://www.glassdoor.com/employers/blog/opening-the-glassdoor-a-wise-move/).

**EDIT 2**: Some people are pointing out that their algorithm had detected an identical review was submitted, which was the reason for my getting banned. Problem is, I didn't leave a second review. Like I said, the original review was live for 2 months and then it was removed for the reasons cited.

**Original**: For the past few years, I've often defended Glassdoor as a useful resource as part of any job-seeker's overall job-seeking toolkit. 

About a year and a half ago, I interviewed with a company that had horrendous reviews. Literally, all 15 reviews were 1-star and for the same reasons. So in the interviews, I brought up some of the themes. The hiring manager, a decent man, admitted to all of it and said he was desperately and single-handedly trying to change those issues. So in this case, the negative reviews weren't a bunch of bitter employees; they were actual experiences and issues.

I elected to join the company based on this honesty and the prospect of a challenge, and of course, it was exactly like how all those reviews had said it would be. It was awful. I was thankfully laid off due to COVID.

After being laid off, I left a very detailed, thorough, cutting review that within a week of being posted, had 6 'helpful' upvotes or whatever. After two months, the review was removed suddenly for violating guidelines and so was every review I had ever written. Incredulous, I reached out to Glassdoor's content management team. They would not tell me exactly what the issue was, just that I was banned from participating in their community. Finally, a service manager emailed me to say they had some proprietary algorithm that had detected language that was in violation of Glassdoor's guidelines. To be clear, I didn't use any community guideline-violating language. Apparently, they detected an identical review had been written elsewhere.

*I have a close family member that works for Glassdoor. I spoke to this person and found out that a very recent strategic repositioning for Glassdoor is that they are trying to become a PR company of sorts, so they are focusing on brand management for companies. As a result, they are getting very aggressive with negative review-takedowns while allowing very obviously fraudulent positive reviews to remain the same.*

This same company from which I was laid off, from June-August, posted 10 5-star reviews, each of which was of similar length, all with just about the same thing to say. Cliches like, ""great culture"", ""build your skills"", ""enlightened management"", ""cool tech"", ""takes care of employees"". I reached out to Glassdoor and asked them to use their ""proprietary algorithm"" to see if there was any fraud in that content, to which they said no, there was no violation.

So, what I'm getting at: with Glassdoor's supposed strategic pivot to brand management, it is becoming even less reliable than it was before.",1602800195.0,2020-10-15 18:16:35

Why train people in your own country when you could just hire people who gained 5 years experience in countries with companies who are willing to hire and train entry level.

If we continue to follow this current trend, we will have 0 qualified people in America, since nobody will hire and train entry level in this country. Every skilled worker will be an import due to this countries failure.

Edit: to add some detail. skilled people exist because they were once hired as entry level. if nobody hires the entry level people, you will always run out of skilled people because you need to be hired at some point to learn and become that high skill employee.",1604558138.0,2020-11-05 01:35:38

Sorry for the delay in my update I've actually been going for interviews (two interviews so far) this week at an unnamed multinational insurance company, so I've been busy preparing and generally stressing out.

Anyways, on to the events of last Friday's company picnic. I did think about not showing up like many of you suggested but I was sure there was an attendance sheet so I thought of another way to go about things. I arrived at the picnic about 15 mins early when everyone was still busy setting up things, found the attendance sheet (or rather booklet) at the sign in table which was thankfully unattended, and discretely rifled through it until I found my name and signed next to it. I then shuffled away to the parking lot, and drove home to spend the rest of the day drinking beer and watching an ungodly number of Narcos episodes. 

The interesting thing is that when I found my name on the attendance sheet I saw that I was listed as belonging to my former, now defunct, department. If the names had been sorted by department it would have raised some red flags but thankfully they were sorted alphabetically so all the departments were jumbled together and I was lost in fray. I'm just one misplaced entry in some spreadsheet or database that someone like me has been too lazy to double-check.

Hopefully I get called back for the third and final interview for the insurance company so I can finally leave this job.",1441350196.0,2015-09-04 03:03:16

7,Serious: I walked into my CEOs office and thanked him,2556,c255l2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c255l2/serious_i_walked_into_my_ceos_office_and_thanked/,123,"I have been working with my company for about 2 years now. It’s a small to medium sized company with less than 100 employees generating about $100M+ /year rev. I don’t hold the best paying roles and I had been hopeful for a raise of some sort. Especially my reviews with my bosses were always positive. 


Right before last Christmas (2018) my baby boy was diagnosed with a rare case of infant leukemia (blood cancer). Doctors in the ICU gave us less than 20% survival rate. Both my wife and I were devastated and felt like we got sucked into a black hole of sadness. My boss talks with his boss and allows me to be off for 2 weeks. Last thing I had in my mind was work and they understood that. Soon we received the road map for the infant cancer treatment protocol and we were expected to be inpatient for basically the first 6 months of the 24 months treatment. 

Right before the end of 2 weeks, I receive an email from my HR with my CEO cc’d in it stating that my company is granting me UNLIMITED PTO. I was not expected to do any work but to invest all my time with my baby. And that’s what I did. I stayed in the hospital for 6 long months at the cancer unit. 

After finishing the front line of treatment ( first 6 months), my son went in remission (MRD negative) and we came home . My wife officially quit her job to stay with him at home and I decided to come back to work as our life is getting some sort of flow. 

After coming back to work, I heard from others how my CEO took the initiative to the board and other co-founders and pushed to offer the support I received. 

So recently I saw him at his office and his door was open. So I knocked on the side and walked into his office. I was very nervous but I shook his hand and thanked him for all he had done for me and my family and how helpful it was for us to have at least one income. He quietly listens to me and says “we didn’t want you worry about work while you’re taking care of your family and that was the right thing to do” and he stood up and gave me a big bear hug. 


My heart is filled with gratitude and respect for him and the entire company. Small companies have challenges and they make mistakes as they grow. But these types of act of kindness makes me want to work for this company as long as I can.


Edit: thank you everyone for reading this post. A lot of people are asking for the name of the company to give kudos. I didn’t mention any name because I wanted their kindness to maintain its innocence. Maybe I’ll ask.",1560907862.0,2019-06-18 21:31:02

Please put your health and wellness before them.,2226,bdgd2c,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bdgd2c/companies_and_corporations_do_not_care_about_you/,255,"I never understood why people would skip their breaks or lunch in order to work more. I understand that you want that promotion, but a promotion is not worth your health and wellness. Take your breaks, take your lunch, and do your job well. When you are not at work... you are not at work. You do not have to answer your phone or talk to anyone (unless that was specifically discussed before you got the job).



Companies and corporations do not care about you. They care about what you do, and how much you can do. They will abuse you if you let them. They will replace you in a heartbeat. You are worth more than them, and so there is nothing wrong with quitting or putting in your 2 weeks to find a better paying (and treating) job. If that job ends up doing the same thing, rinse and repeat. Fuck them if they try to make you do more than you AGREED to.



You are not a hard worker if you start work before you are scheduled to and work after your scheduled time to leave has passed. You are not a hard worker if you work on your lunch. You are not a hard worker if you work on your break. You are not a hard worker if you come to work on your days off because they asked you to. You are not a hard worker if you do work from home outside your scheduled time because they asked you to. All you are, is a fucking idiot.



But hey, lets be honest, 90% of people (who actually read this) will wholeheartedly agree with me, then start doing the same stuff that they are doing (examples that I mentioned above).



The ones who disagree? Well, the only reasons they disagree, is because they are trying to make themselves feel better by justifying why they are doing these things for a company or corporation that simply does not care about them.



Or worse, they actually think that they do care about them.



Your health and wellness is important, always put it before your job. You will live longer and be happier.

I have not included introductory calls from recruitment agencies. These are pure interviews.

I'd like to say that ghosting is the most awful thing especially after speaking to recruiters or companies multiple times and then they just vanish or not respond. I understand, there's a big pool of unemployed people but I wish companies had some decency to say, ""sorry, you were not successful"".

Placement agencies are some of the worst people I've had to deal with. They say ""oh, you would be a great fit for X company"" and then you follow up, they don't respond. Three weeks later, they post another role similar to the original one and they say ""you don't match it""???

Worse than that, I went through FIVE rounds of Zoom interviews for one role. I did not get it in the end. It was a lot of wasted time and regurgitated questions and answers. Why not do a panel style interview?

HireVue is the worst invention in the recruiting field, imo. It's so awkward and you can see yourself answer the questions and ugh. Never again.

Additionally, I think employers are underpaying new recruits. I think it's wild that you need 3 years experience and the pay is $40,000 CAD.

My observation is that some employers love to ask ""where do you see yourself in 5 years?"" and love hearing ""more responsibilities"" but don't like hearing ""new opportunities, different role"". This one place said we want this person to be in the role for 5+ years.. oh at 40k too. No thanks.

Most interesting process was at a large scale company where I went through 5 interviews with directors, VPs, HR. I thought it went well, considering it was FIVE interviews. I was told that we liked you but the team didn't. We're considering you for a different role. Still my #1 place I'd like to work tbh.

In terms of jobs that I declined after interviewing and the reasoning behind it:

1. Advertised as ""small but growing firm"", employee count: 3, salary was $65k. Dude was being super weird about if I would share company information or my salary with others. I said no to both and he's like are you sure? what if you were out for drinks? what if someone says come on, just tell us?? I already said I would't but he kept asking. Not sure what he wanted to hear.
2. ""Growing real estate firm"" - office is dingy and in a weird location. Every answer I gave, the guy said ""oh interestiiiiing"" Why? I don't know. It was an person interview and he asked me if he should wear his mask during the interview? I said, yes, I prefer that. He said ""interesting"" and only covered his mouth.... My blood is boiling as I'm typing this.
3. Mat Leave role (12-18 months) - went through 2 rounds, first was phone screen. Second was with HR on Zoom. I honestly thought it was just 2 rounds but no, they said there'll be a culture/fit interview for 5 hours. FIVE hours. I said no, thank you. What do you need to know about me that you already don't know in the past 2 rounds?

**Takeaway:**

Keep applying. Don't accept lowball roles. HireVue is the worst and there are too many idiots in the recruiting world and companies think they can treat you like trash :) Multiple rounds are not needed to figure out if you fit. I think 2 rounds are standard but 5 is ridiculous. 5 hours of culture/fit is ridiculous too. What does ""overqualified"" mean anyway? I'm not entry level but I'm not managerial level either, I get it.

I also wish people took a chance on applicants that have most of the qualifications but I understand the way it works now. They don't want to spend time training you when another applicant can have everything.

Pay your employees well. When I heard one of the roles was paying $40k. I nearly lost my mind but I was desperate so I said okay. They ghosted me. Employers need to realize that this will just be a stepping stone role and once an applicant finds a better role, they will leave. TRUST ME.

Success:

1 offer. Matched my last role's salary. Permanent Full Time. I found this role by myself on Indeed.

Thank you for reading! Any questions - please ask. I can't believe the way the job market is right now but please keep applying. Fine tune your resume - tailor it to the job description!

Good Luck! Wishing you all the very best.",1598564381.0,2020-08-27 17:39:41
14,Ended interview in the middle,1885,b1kf03,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b1kf03/ended_interview_in_the_middle/,163,"This afternoon I had a phone interview for what I thought looked like a good opportunity.  It ended up being one of the worst interviews I ever (partially) sat through.  The interview was obviously reading from a list of questions, everyone of which was a negative:

1. Have you ever worked with someone that you felt was not trust worthy?
2. Have you ever witnessed or been asked to do anything unethical?
3. How do you deal with co-workers that you don't get along with?
4. What would you do if you saw a co-worker stealing from the workplace?
5. (My favorite) Is it ever okay to bend the rules at work?

I let the interviewer get through about ten or so of these questions, waiting to see if there would be any neutral or positive questions.  When there weren't, I apologized for interrupting and asked her if all the questions were of this nature.  She asked me what I meant, so I explained that every question she had asked me was about negative situations and I was wondering if there would be any questions about good things?  There wouldn't be...

&#x200B;

I let her know that I understood the need to assess my ability to deal with difficult and uncomfortable situations, however this line of questioning lead me to believe that the company had a dim view of employees and that this was not an environment I was interested in working in.  I thanked her for her time and let her know that there was no need to continue the interview. ",1552713856.0,2019-03-16 01:24:16

19,"I can't be the only one who finds LinkedIn completely insufferable, right?",1732,bjm1vz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bjm1vz/i_cant_be_the_only_one_who_finds_linkedin/,310,"When I was in university, like many other college students, I was told that LinkedIn is the ""future of networking and finding jobs"" and that everyone should have one. So I made an account and have kept it up-to-date with my experiences, photos, volunteer work, etc. for the last 5 or so years.

Yet I completely find it insufferable, useless, and detestable.

It's the faux-optimism in every post; the stupid buzzwords; the pretentious people who describe their job or college experiences as #careerdefining; the feeling that no one knows what they're doing on there, but continue to like posts about new business ventures by Facebook or Apple because their college career service helper told them to; startup companies that post #inspirational stories about a candidate they met that changed how they hired people because he doesn't have a college degree, but damn it that motherfucker wrote a story in his blog about some company needing to be more #progressive.

I'm not asking for everyone to be as cynical as me, I just want some realism and for everyone to not come across so fake.

Perhaps I'm not 'doing LinkedIn the right way', and that might be true. However, I don't know anyone besides the most hardcore of career professionals who do LinkedIn the 'right way'. 98% of people I know 'network' with their friends and coworkers and that's it. Maybe once in awhile they will ""network"" with people from a convention or someplace similar.

No one actually connects with someone they don't know, and if you're in a career where networking isn't needed or valued than what's the point?

I've never once gotten a job or even a whiff of a job from any one of my contacts. I've reached out to many, many contacts on LinkedIn and no one actually wants to help. They all say they want to help, but unless they have something immediately within reach, you're on your own; your network is useless.

I could go on and on, but in the end LinkedIn just feels, again, useless. The feed is a big circle jerk of people throwing around big buzzwords that they don't understand or care about (#inclusion and #inspiration, amiright?) to make themselves look hip, and your network provides nothing of value unless you're constantly working it; messaging people, going to events, keeping with your connections, creating posts, liking posts, etc. And, again, the vast majority of jobs, at least in the United States, are not conducive to that level of maintenance; plus, most people don't give a shit.

And yet I drudge on because everyone and their mother says that recruiters look at your LinkedIn when deciding to hire you so I keep it just in case. I can't wait until I retire so I can delete my LinkedIn once and for all.

Does anyone feel the same way, or am I just a jaded man who can't adapt to the site the way it's meant to be used?

EDIT: Damn, this blew up; thanks everyone! I'm glad so many also hate LinkedIn. The opposing opinions on how the service is useful are also really great to read.

One thing I would like to clarify is that I already have a wonderful job. This is just me looking for input on something I've always thought. I don't need career advice or help with my LinkedIn profile, currently. I keep it up to date, and believe it to be better than most of my connections. But thank you everyone for the advice otherwise.",1556771366.0,2019-05-02 00:29:26
20,I have slipped through the cracks at my company and have not done anything for the past month,1658,3dfnuq,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3dfnuq/i_have_slipped_through_the_cracks_at_my_company/,246,"As the title implies I have been going into work for the past month, sitting at my desk and surfing the web (mostly reddit) or playing computer games silently, and then going home.

Some backstory, I used to work in a department that was quite autonomous within the company and was actually created by my boss who was an associate VP in the company. I was hired directly (circumventing the usual HR procedures) by my boss as an executive assistant because he was a family friend. It was a pretty decent paying job for a recent grad and I was kept moderately busy answering calls, scheduling, preparing presentations/reports, etc. 

However, my boss was fired last month and the department was shutdown (my company leases office buildings and my boss wanted to start leasing industrial properties as well and failed) so all the coworkers in my department were either let go or reassigned. The problem is that when HR was going through this process and interviewing my coworkers, I was never called to meet with them (probably due to the way I was hired).

While my department was being dismantled I kept coming into the office and going to my original desk. The peculiar thing is that when new employees were being moved into my department's area of the building no one was assigned to the executive's office so therefore no one was assigned to the executive assistant desk. The new employees that moved in were mostly overflow from different departments so no one really works together or has the same manager.  It's been a month and no one has really questioned what I do or what department I'm a part of (I can easily deflect any work related small talk), and I'm still getting paid.

I'm pretty certain if I bring attention to my situation I will be immediately fired because I was the specially hired executive assistant to a VP who lost the company a fair bit of money. I have been looking for alternative jobs but all the jobs that I'm qualified for don't pay nearly as much as what I currently make. Also, I would have to actually do work if I got a new job. The only reason I still come into work is that I don't want to throw up any red flags because each employee is recorded entering and leaving the building by scanning their badge.

I'm thinking about riding this gravy train as long as I can before I eventually get found out and fired. Any comments or suggestions are welcome.

Even if the job is easy to do.

It's nearly impossible for young people to gather that much work experience since they were usually in college full time during the first 4-5 years of their lives.

I remember when I was 23, my usual rejection was not having any experience. How was I suppose to get work experience if no one ever hires me in the first place? Especially when I was already busy with school full time.

Before anyone says 'nonpaid internship' it's not like I can call my landlord and tell him I'm paying rent with nonpaid dollars this month.

So what ends up happening is young(ish) people are never able to reach that adulthood milestone known as the middleclass.

I have college educated friends in their 30s who were never able to break out of the service industry since they weren't able to tick that HR box off needing x amount of experience for x job.

The ironic thing is these same jobs usually only required a HS diploma years ago. For example administration related work.

I said as corporate-y and HR-y as possible ""Well, I would like to be compensated fairly for the work that I do, and at this stage of the interview process, I would not feel comfortable suggesting an amount without knowing my full responsibilities. Given my skill set, what do you feel is fair compensation for me working this role?""

They slightly changed their response but essentially repeated themselves again. I did the same and repeated myself again.

Boom. ""For this role our range is ____ to ____ annually. Where do you think you and your skill set fall into this?""

**Resume** - I basically used [this template](https://old.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/), except I put education at the top. I had 8 slightly differing versions of my resume for the different kinds of jobs I was applying for.

**Cover Letter** - I wish I could find the original author of the template I started with, but this ended up being my basic cover letter:

*Dear Hiring Manager,*

*I'm enthusiastically writing regarding the [POSITION] at [PLACE], which I discovered on [WEBSITE]. I have over [NUMBER] years of related experience and am excited to bring my creativity and energy to [PLACE].*

*The job description mentioned that you were looking for [QUALITY, QUALITY, and QUALITY].*

*As you can see from my resume, I’ve [DESCRIPTION OF JOB DUTIES THAT SHOWS I CAN DO QUALITY, QUALITY, and QUALITY]. I [DUTY, DUTY, ACCOMPLISHMENT].* 

*This multifaceted role has made me a [QUALITY, QUALITY], capable of [TASK].*

*I’m confident that I have the skills and ability to be an asset to [PLACE]. Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.*

*Sincerely,*

*[YOUR NAME]*

**Interview** - I obsessively honed my pitch and practiced with [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNSMPrvEWxo).

**Websites** - I was looking primarily on Indeed and [NYFA](https://www.nyfa.org/jobs/), but sometimes Craigslist and LinkedIn, too.

---

**Closing Thoughts**

* *Personalize, personalize, personalize* - I really started getting somewhere when I started personalizing my resume for each job. Eventually, I had 8 slightly different versions of my resume ready to go, which I would personalize even more for each job.

* *Including interests on your resume* - Yes, I started including interests on most of my resumes, and I started getting more interest. I kept it very brief and specific. My resume for the job I ultimately accepted, however, did not have any interests on it.

As we all know, this is an incredibly tedious process. I certainly felt depressed and worthless at times. I just kept telling myself: this is a numbers game, and I just have to stay in the game to win. I saw every application as increasing my chances of winning the numbers game, even if only slightly. Additionally, I was very inspired by the folks on here who racked up 300 applications in the same time I had done 130.

To everyone still applying: you got this!

**EDIT 11/18/2020 11:00 AM EST - Thank you all for your kind well-wishes! I thought I'd compile my answers to the most frequently asked questions here:** 

**Are you entry level? How many jobs did you apply to per day and per week, on average?** - *tltr4560 (Thank you!)*

Not entry level. I’m 28 with 4 years of experience in management. I applied to 5-7 jobs a day max, but sometimes I only managed to do 1 job a day. I was very slow because I was researching the companies, personalizing my resume and cover letter a lot, etc.

**What kind of position did you end up in?** *- RogueMimzy (Thank you!)*

I took an administrative position at a well-known organization, but not directly in my field.

**What did you do to improve your interview skills?** *- kbflower (Thank you!)*

The best interview advice I got was: peg your answers to your accomplishments, i.e., figure out what the most impressive things are about you and connect every interview answer to one or more of those. I really worked on this because I'm naturally not someone who brags about themselves.

So, for example, if someone says, ""Tell me about yourself,"" old me would have said, ""I'm [NAME], I'm from Colorado and I teach painting.""

New me had a spiel: ""I'm an artist, teacher, and manager. I started my interest in [FIELD] at [SCHOOL]. In my current position, I'm the manager at [PLACE], where I directly supervise 10 people. The studio makes an average revenue of $800,000 a year, and I've brought that up from $500,000 in 2017. I oversee all hiring, onboarding, and operational initiatives, while also teaching painting at [PLACE] to groups of up to 50 adults at a time."" etc. 

Obviously those details are a little fudged but you get the idea. I practiced with my friends and with [the video I linked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNSMPrvEWxo) until it was second nature. You don't want to memorize word for word, of course, but you want to know what points you're going to bring up every time.

**Do you have any suggestions for the final rounds of interviews?** - *sassylilmidge (Thank you!)*

I really can't call myself an expert on final rounds since I've only done it 5 times. These are my general thoughts, though:

* **Anticipating common interview questions** - At the lower levels (where I am), there are only so many interview questions that get asked (even in the second and third rounds). I found [this free Balance Careers website](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/job-interview-questions-and-answers-2061204) very helpful for all of that. They have lists of common interview questions and suggestions for how to answer. I came up with my answers for pretty much all common interview questions and practiced them obsessively.

* **Peg your answers to your accomplishments** - I wrote a little about that above. Basically, figure out what the most impressive things are about you and connect every interview answer to one or more of those. So if someone asked the classic, ""How do you handle stress and pressure?"" I had a semi-memorized answer ready to go that connected back to a striking, memorable accomplishment. E.g.: ""In my current position, I run a lot of high-pressure, high-stress events. I remember one time, I was overseeing an event for the entire cast of the Lion King on Broadway and everything needed to be perfect. It turns out they needed a red carpet and a photo backdrop, but it seems like there was a miscommunication and the information didn't make it to us. So, my coworker and I sprang into action... [DETAILS] and, in the end, the night went off perfectly. No one even noticed a thing. I deal with challenging situations by leaping into action and doing everything I can in the here and now."" I would be brief, but make the example as funny and vivid as possible. 

* **Get your most successful friend to critique your interviewing skills** (multiple times if possible) - This was painful, but helpful. I picked the most successful person I know and asked them to do several mock interviews with me. Most people will be flattered to be asked. **1) You want to practice until it's automatic.** In the first practice round, I would fall apart during basic questions out of nervousness (and because the situation was so weird). By the later rounds, I had a smooth, but natural (I hope) patter down. **2) Their feedback will be really important.** They might tell you you need to brag more, or say that one of your anecdotes is particularly interesting and you need to find a way to work it in earlier. **3) If possible, get them to practice with you the night/morning before interviews so you're not walking in completely cold.** Eventually I stopped relying on this, but I found it helpful for my first few 2+ round interviews.

**Did you include personal hobby type interests or professional goals/interests?** - *Packynin (Thank you!)*

Personal interests only. My exact line (when I included it) was: ""**Interests** – Camping, hiking, bicycling, drawing, mycology.""

As a side note - I'm Asian, and we are sometimes stereotyped as being all the same, boring robot drones, etc. I felt like adding the interests might have humanized me to hiring managers.

I didn't put any professional goals. I used to do some hiring and never found those sections that interesting. But it's probably different for other industries.

**Would the template apply to a college student with no work or internship experience? All feedback I've gotten so far is that my experience is not relevant. Do my extracurriculars and projects hold any merit for anyone...?** *- beetles_juiced (Thank you!)*

I'd need more details to give you good advice, but there's usually a way to spin your accomplishments in the best possible light. I interviewed for a lot of positions where I had no direct experience in that specific field.

I usually read the job description, isolated the tasks that were most similar to things I had done, and then rewrote a few bullet points in my resume to directly address those tasks.

So for example, if I saw a job description like this:

*REQUIREMENTS:
• Experience with social media, notably Instagram (all aspects: writing posts, promotion, documenting engagement with followers)
• Proficiency in Microsoft Office and web research; and with Adobe Creative Suite is a plus. 
• Strong organizational, verbal, writing and problem-solving skills. 
• BA degree in Fine Art, Art History, or experience in a related field.*

I would think to myself, okay: I don't have experience with Instagram, and web research isn't a huge part of my job. But I could spin my resume in the best possible light with something truthful and relevant, like this:

* *Created original content for company social media accounts.*

* *Researched market trends to support and develop new operational initiatives. Assisted senior management with status follow-ups and progress reports.*

Maybe not the best example, but you get the idea.

I work in a small office and we had interviews going on today. While one interview was going on, another interviewee was waiting in our waiting area near where my supervisor and I sit. She quietly and politely walked up to my desk and said “this is really embarrassing but I’m not feeling very well. I had too much coffee and not enough to eat this morning so I really feel like I might pass out. Is there a vending machine nearby that I can get some water from?” Now being someone that has this same issue happen to me, along with currently job seeking and going through interview processes myself, I immediately told her “please sit down! I’ll go grab you a water and a granola bar. Don’t be embarrassed.” I wanted her to feel comfortable and not nervous or embarrassed. 

This poor girl was definitely mortified but I tried to make it out to be no big deal, as it really wasn’t. She seemed okay after that and did well in her interview apparently.

I realized I had to move to a different company at that point. 


Fast forward a couple of months to December 2020, I get a new offer with a mid-January start date so I'm preparing to resign on the 4th of January. The team leader of my old team quit and ""leadership"" won't hire a replacement even though they have 3 people doing the work of 6. I get calls from the manager of my old team asking me if I'm interested in back- filling the team leader role. Apparently it has now been downgraded to an individual contributor role, but the organization thought they'd do me a favor and give me a pay bump and a level bump. I said I do not want to move back because it would be a step down in my career. I get told ""You can either take the job with the pay bump or stay in your role and have work added to your plate anyway"". Later in the day, I get a call from the director of the region, more or less the same conversation and I ask ""What if I say no?"". I hear ""You can say no and as long as you report to xxx (director's subordinate) we won't hold it as a negative against you but having said that I'm not sure how the organization will perceive it. This is massively beneficial to the organization and you need to remember they can do anything to us at any time"".

I'm glad I was planning on leaving any way, but I shudder to think what would have happened if I didn't have a way out. This story is to remind people to put yourself ahead of your employer at all times. There is absolutely no need to feel guilty about taking a new job opportunity or asking for more money.",1608576152.0,2020-12-21 13:42:32

In order to cope better with life's punches, there are people want to believe that we live in a society where meritocracy rules. Essentially, if you do everything ""right,"" you will be rewarded and if you're not rewarded, you just need to do better next time or try harder.

However, these same individuals also have a tendency to severely underestimate how factor such as luck can factor into our life's success. Often, the reality of the matter is the reason(s) you were rejected have absolutely nothing to do with what you did ""wrong."" When you apply for a job, there's nothing you can do to control the fact that someone (or several people) also applied for the same position who have more experience and education. You also can't control the fact that one person or several other people interviewed just as well as you did. You also can't control the fact that a company isn't willing to pay for your relocation if it's a position out-of-state. Neither can you control the fact that a company has suddenly decided to go on a hiring freeze. Nor can you control the fact that one of the applicants are best friends or a nephew or a cousin with the hiring.

I can go on and on, but I'm posting this to remind everyone that while you can still give the best interview ever or have the bestest Resume format of anyone, the fact is these are about the only things you can control in a situation. There are so many external factors that can cause you to get passed over for a job that have nothing to do with your worth or qualifications as a candidate.

What I tell everyone is that job hunting is like the lottery. It's a numbers game and all you can do is apply to as many jobs that you're even remotely qualified for to increase your chances at landing a job. For one, this helps to keep you from getting emotionally invested into any one position. But also, like with playing the lottery, eventually life's equilibrium will be reached and you will finally end up being at the right place at the right time for an opportunity.",1592863729.0,2020-06-22 18:08:49

They outright lie on Indeed, saying that it pays minimum wage and it’s on a shop floor and yet at interview they reveal its commission selling fans or stationary door to door etc. These types of things are the only applications I hear back from and it’s killing me.

I also had an interview which I feel so stupid for attending in hindsight. The guy running it pretended it was an up and coming “hip” store and therefore he wanted young people working there. He asked for a pic of my face to determine whether I fit the theme of the store. I was desperate so I sent a pic. Was invited to group interview. There were about 15 other reasonably attractive young girls. At the interview he declared it was yet another door to door sales scam but I was creeped out by his obsession with how we looked. I got talking to the other girls and a few of us (around half) made a groupchat together and all agreed it was shady and we all agreed we weren’t having anything to do with it. I don’t know what came of the others but I hope they didn’t get taken in.

I’ve really lost my temper today after spending 2 hours on a situational awareness test only to be told at the end “Sorry, you failed. Reapply again in 6 months”. No respect for my time whatsoever.

As someone who's been in the corporate world for a long time at a very high level, here's my number one rule of decision making:

The business NEVER cares about you. You might have managers that like you, maybe the CEO even likes you (if you work at a small business) but at the end of the day you are judged by your ability to make the company money.

If there ever comes a day where you stop making the company money, or the company decides it can make more money by cutting your job or hiring someone new, they will do so without a second thought.

They won't care that you have debt that needs to be paid off. They won't care you just had a kid and can't afford to lose your job. They won't care your mother is in the hospital and your salary is the only thing keeping the collectors at bay. They will fire  you while you're on vacation, they'll let you go after ten years of service. They will make the decision without consulting you and they won't bat an eye. 

So treat your business the same way. Always act in YOUR best interest. 

Got another job offer that pays better? Take it.

Got a demotion and your boss is treating you like crap? Leave and never look back.

Want to know if you should include some embarrassing or harmful information on your resume` that wouldn't come up in a background check? Don't. 

This is not advice from a jaded veteran. I love what I do, I love where I work, and I'm paid very, very well. But I'd still walk away in a heartbeat. 

Be loyal to your family, your friends, and your dog, but not to your company. Because you can be damn sure they won't always be loyal to you.",1493267250.0,2017-04-27 00:27:30

Probably the most demeaning thing about looking for a job is having literally all of the experience and qualifications for the role, and still receiving a “no-reply” email that says “Unfortunately, after reviewing your application, we don't see you being a fit for this particular role.”

So I’m not a fit before you even speak to me, why? You don’t like the font I chose for my resume?

The kicker in this particular instance is that I was recommended by someone who works there. When my boyfriend was recommended to this same company as an engineer (by the same person), he didn’t have to apply. His resume was given to a recruiter and that recruiter reached out to him directly for an interview.

But for an HR role, I have to apply even after a recommendation, get zero acknowledgment, followed by a rejection I can’t even respond to.

I am surprised by this because I have never done this to people. Even being in human resources myself, I hadn't realized just how disrespectful this entire process has become until I started applying a few months ago. How are we all supposed to navigate this without completely losing our sense of worth?

I feel so defeated.

**For those of you who have been nice to me**, thank you.

**Those in the same boat**, I wish you luck and if you want to network with me, feel free to DM.

**For those who have been rude and/or told me they hope I die because I chose to be in a field that is notoriously sh\*tty, so that I can try to make it less sh\*tty**, I wish you well and hope someday you understand there are people working for change.

There are good people in every field, but when the majority are people without respect and/or empathy, it's maddening. Many of the people in my field make me feel sick. I keep going because I know employees & potential employees deserve to be treated well, and if I can do that, maybe I can at least make a difference on a small scale.

I am a strong person, and even I break, sometimes. And then decide to vent to the internet.

Running low on money I got a referral for an IT Network Job. The last time I had done anything IT NEtworking related was bac in 2006. To say I was out of my element was an understatement. But...I had a couple things going for me

&#x200B;

THis company really needed another warm body to really fulfill their contract obligations

Per the rules surrounding the contract as long as I could me demonstrate some knowledge and was able to obtain my CCNA within 6 months I would be hired, but if I didn't have my CCNA within the 6 months I'd be fired.

My first interview was on the phone I had literally just started studying the day before, I used google to make it to the 2nd round.

The 2nd round was scheduled for 5 days later I studied like a mad man. I get into the interview, tired cause I had spent the night studying and I was honest and even told them. The interviewer said lets see how this goes

It was a grueling interview, and something I had a lot of gaps in my knowledge but through what I remember back in 2006 and my 5 days of studying I was able to get through it. I knew the fact that I didn't have active certs was going hurt me.

A week later I get a call, asking me how soon I can start I tell them if they want me I can start in 15 minutes. He laughs and says alright I'll let you know.

A few days later I find out they made an offer to another person they interviewed, I was confident I had lost the job but decided to keep on studying. I knew if this job fell through I'd have another one on the horizon.  


A week later I get called, they want to do a zoom interview, and ask me to do it on zoom and share my screen. They wanted to make sure I wasn't googling my way through the interview.  I was told at the start of the interview if I could show a noticeable improvement in my knowledge I'd likely be offered the job.  


I complete the 2 hour interview, and they say they are going talk about it and call me back. It was a very technical interview, I felt like I did better.

&#x200B;

2 hours later I get a call back and they ask me if I can start that Monday, its a Thursday. I say of course. They tell me I get the job so long as I can get my cert within 6 months if I don't I'll be fired.

&#x200B;

That was 3 months ago and my co-workers have been awesome. I learn way better by doing and I'm super lucky to have that chance. I felt like I learned way more on the job, I had to ask a lot of questions, do a lot of googling. Then 2 weeks ago my manager pulls me aside and tells me he thinks I got it. I ask him what makes him so sure, and he's like ""Because I don't see you on your phone googling as much as I used too, you should go take your exam, if you fail you'll get another chance before your 6 month mark""

Here's what worked for me:

* First off, when you have bad days, let yourself be sad. Trying to stay positive all the time is exhausting and not healthy. But remind yourself that how you're feeling now is not how you will feel forever. Make sure to surround yourself with people who love and support you. Seek support here, when you need it! We get it. 

*Keep growing and developing yourself into the person you want to be. That will be attractive to employers, but more importantly, you owe it to yourself! I took on a couple volunteer opportunities that kept me feeling useful and kept me growing as a person (one was a longtime dream of mine: I became an adult literacy tutor, so I was learing how to teach and develop lessons while helping someone improve their reading and writing skills. Win-win!)

*Keep up your self-care. I maintained pretty good eating habits, exercised regularly, and tried to meditate (and take meditation lessons) most days.

*Take some low-cost classes that will sound attractive to employers. I took a project management class via Coursera (I recommend them as a learning platform) and Spanish lessons from Pimsleur. Again, I kept learning and growing, but specifically in ways that I knew would look good on my resume and in interviews when I was asked ""what have you been doing since you quit your job?""

*Here's a big one: Goddammit, give yourself breaks from job searching. It is exhausting and can feel demoralizing. I took weekends off. Just relaxed, without guilt. It kept me sane.

Ultimately, I really feel I landed a job in part because I took really good care of myself psychically and physically, and I became the person I wanted to be, which equalled confidence. When I had that initial phone screening with the company that eventually hired me, I was relaxed because I knew I'd be ok whether they liked me or not, so I just tried to think about it like a mutually exploratory conversation. 

The job hunt is ridiculously tough on applicants. It is hard. Take care of yourself, and develop that inner confidence. If anyone ever needs a boost, feel free to DM me!",1603087934.0,2020-10-19 02:12:14

I applied for a position and in the initial application there were numerous mandatory fields to fill out including things like *why you want to work for this company*, *what can you bring to this company*, *why are you qualified for this role*, *what can you tell us about our company values*, *tell us about yourself* and so on. There was also a cover letter required on top of all of this. Insane, but it gets worse.

After applying there were multiple assessments required, one a typing speed test, another a personality test *(this should be illegal IMO, I've literally been rejected based on my introverted personality before, I've since learned to lie)* and another ""attention to detail"" test. The worst was answering mock customer service questions which required extensive research of the company's product on their website in order to be able to answer correctly, there were 5 of these and they alone took the better part of an hour.

But we're still not done. Next I get sent a link for a one way video interview where you record your answers to various questions. I HATE these, usually I refuse to do them, but I'm desperate, so I get my shirt and tie on, I even put pants on, set everything up and spend about 45 mins to an hour answering the questions in an extremely awkward fashion, thank god you get three attempts...

Long time lurker, first time posting. I started keeping up with this thread when I was at my lowest. Here’s some background:

In June this year I graduated. It was supposed to be a happy moment but I guess COVID impacted me more than expected and I got a 2:2 (really close to my 2:1 target). Guys, I was DISTRAUGHT. I legitimately could not stop crying and I thought that I had just wasted my time at university basically. All that was going through my head was that competition was already tough, COVID was ruining the job market and now I was even LESS employable.

Then, I got fired from my admin job. My employers didn’t like the time I took off work to finish my degree and made up some bs about having to let me go. I got my last pay check which didn’t last very long and soon I was living out of my graduate overdraft.

I started applying for jobs. I did a law degree so at first I tried looking at legal jobs. I didn’t get anywhere with that so then I basically began applying to anything that I thought I could do. I used every job platform and applied in various cities with little success. I even applied to a supermarket I used to be a manager at and got rejected. I felt hopeless.

Meanwhile, anytime I’d log onto LinkedIn I’d see people my age or my classmates celebrating landing great jobs. I felt demotivated and useless. As I was getting to the end of my overdraft and spending more time at home doing nothing I got more and more upset over being unemployed. One day I just broke down in tears because not only did I really need a job (money) but also I hated not doing anything. 

Things started to get better in the sense that I began to get more interviews however, I would either get put on a waiting list or rejected.

Being so desperate, I applied for a job at an Amazon Warehouse (if you are really strapped for cash I recommend: decentish pay, long hours & very simple job). I was happy to have money but the job itself was soul draining and boring. I’m not the type to look down on jobs however, I felt disappointed that I hadn’t got something yet related to my degree. 

Two weeks later (yesterday) I attended an interview for a compliance role. I didn’t have high hopes but I prepared so much and practiced a lot. After 20 minutes the hiring manager expressed his satisfaction and asked how I felt about doing my second interview right there and then with a senior member of staff. I agreed and this morning I was offered the job. 

This subreddit helped me a lot and I guess I just wanted to say, DON’T give up. It’s easier said than done, trust me I know but just remember if you’re at rock bottom you can only go up from there. Sometimes it only takes one person to see your potential and give you a chance.

Another important tip I would give is invest in yourself. In my time unemployed I contacted three careers advisors, got my CV rewritten/reformatted and had coaching sessions. In total it cost me around £150 which I know not everyone can afford but YouTube and even LinkedIn (sometimes) are great places to find help. Asking friends to see there CV is good and one thing I did was go onto LinkedIn and search for people in my desired field and have a nosey at theirs. 

Also reach out! I randomly connected with someone in my desired industry and now that woman is one of my mentors. The last time we spoke she gave me a full interview prep session and she doesn’t even know me! 

Ironically thanks to COVID many companies are doing online internships. These are great if you lack some experience and can give you amazing talking points in interviews.

I started this job back in February and have been absolutely miserable since. No training, toxic work environment, micromanaging bosses, unrealistic demands, you name it. It's been hell for me and my mental health has gone to shit.

I was basically their one man web development team and it was fucking insane. None of the stuff I was doing was in the job description or even asked about in the interview.

I wanted to quit for so long but I decided to hang in there. I'd rather get fired than walk out on my own as I would at least get severance pay, and I'd get to apply for Employment Insurance. I couldn't apply for jobs as much as I wanted to because I felt so fucking down during these months. Now with a peace of mind I can do all of that and develop my skills a little more. 

I already feel like my old self and I'm just so fucking happy and relieved. If there's anything I've learned from this experience, it's that my mental health will always come first.

To give you an idea on how much of a bitch my boss was, the last thing she said to me was ""enjoy the rest of your day off"". She said this while laughing.

77,"Job hopping is good, contrary to what recruiters, companies and start-ups want you to believe",1025,iemv5x,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iemv5x/job_hopping_is_good_contrary_to_what_recruiters/,144,"I’ve seen quite a few startup founders react badly to their employee leaving companies. They take it on their ego. I’ve seen some of them publicly shame their ex-employees etc. Following are some reasons I believe you shouldn’t stick around in your current job if there’s mental agony or you aren’t getting your due or if there’s a clearly better opportunity elsewhere:

1. The same companies wouldn’t care two hoots when they wish to go through layoffs. Eg. LinkedIn, Uber, Airbnb etc. laid off their employees go despite the fact that they have hundreds of millions of dollars in funds. And they laid off their employees at a time they are unlikely to find another job. Imagine how many of them would have seen their long term future with the company and how many of them would have let other opportunities go to show their “loyalty”.
2. I’ve had recruiters reach out to me in my 2nd month of a new job to poach me..and ironically, asking “why did you change your last job within 2 years”...recruiters and companies want you to ditch your current companies as soon as they need you, but don’t want you to leave forever
3. Days of bonded labor are over..but by terming people as “job hoppers” or calling them out for leaving your company, social pressure is being artificially created to achieve the same effect
4. Working in multiple companies gives you a much broader perspective of business, organizational behavior, and develops you in a broader way. You can easily figure this when you speak to people who’ve spent the last 15-20 years in the same company.
5. Companies often take their “loyal” employees for granted and the new recruits are almost always able to negotiate better salaries and titles with a similar experience. When you are inside the company, your career and salary grow in a linear way, and this is why companies love long-serving employees.
6. The same founders who love “long term players” sell their companies at the first opportunity.

If you believe in yourself, you should never be worried about switching your job if you feel you are being taken for granted or aren’t enjoying your life working at your current company.

Having said this, In the current times, I would recommend keeping your job because the opportunities are limited and the economy is uncertain.",1598147088.0,2020-08-22 21:44:48

You made it very clear during training that “while it is not required of you to stay late, people who do this job well are going to take that extra time at the end of the day to make sure that they have everything done. They will also answer emails from work and make sure last minute things are done. They will also answer texts and take calls from the people we work with if necessary.” That’s fine. I’ve been doing that. I did all of that, made sure to reply to people when needed, stayed an extra half hour every day, even drove to a different office an hour away even though I wasn’t being paid drive time. I’ve never taken my state mandated 15 minute break. On Monday, you looked at the clock and saw that it was 15 minutes past my scheduled shift and you started asking me questions about reports and I stood there for a few extra minutes telling you what was going on. That was already after you made me come in a half hour early without asking if that was okay. We already work 9 hour days 4 days a week there is no cushion room to stay late.

I’m sorry that I walked in 5 minutes late today because I’m exhausted from working here. I get that that’s still an issue and my fault, and I can accept that. I’ll be sure not to do it again, but I also will be walking out of here at exactly when my shift is over, whether or not things are done.

My supervisor and my coworker are best friends. They have made this workplace unnecessarily miserable. Right after I joined this company, they tried to manipulate me to hate another coworker that I needed to work with on a daily basis. They always called her names and asked me to collect ""evidence"" of her ""poor work"" and bullied her at meetings. I noticed that she had fixed all the mistakes I mentioned and we have been getting along pretty great. 

The coworker that I work with in the same office barely works, yet my supervisor gave her Employee of the Month, which was a big slap in my face. My coworker does almost nothing besides chit-chatting with my supervisor, running her errands, gossiping. When she does work (30 min\~1 hour a day), she won't stop asking me very basic questions again and again. She has been working here for 3 years, but she acts like every day is her first day.

My supervisor NEVER gave me any positive feedback. It was hilarious when the HR told me my supervisor needed my help and said I was great. In my one year working here, she either blamed me for things that were not even my job (it was my coworker's job, but they would use ""we are a team"" card and I always ended up being the only one working) or no feedback at all. I have been working at this place for almost a year. No performance review, no pay raise. My coworker, on the other hand, does close to zero work, received Employee of the Month twice since I joined (first time for ""doing a good job training me"", the second time for I don't know what), received a good review and a pay raise a few months ago.

I am done. Two weeks ago we had a confirmed Covid case and I requested to rest at home since I was one of the direct contacts. They kept sending me work stuff via text messages and I was furious. Apparently, they got assigned work but they didn't want to deal with it. My supervisor tried to make me feel guilty for working from home, by saying that ""you're the only one remote"". No ""feel better soon"", just work and guilt-tripping.

In the past few months, I have been suffering from fatigue and headaches. Last week my health got worse because of the Covid scare. So I finally decided to listen to my body.

Since I gave my two weeks on Monday, I have been feeling a lot healthier. I can finally see the end.

https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3g15f6/update_i_have_slipped_through_the_cracks_at_my/

Things have been pretty quiet at my work for the past 3 weeks. I still come into work everyday, spend the mornings answering my aunt's emails and my afternoons looking for other jobs and aimlessly surfing the web. However, I may be facing a huge problem this Friday. 

There is a mandatory picnic/corporate team building thing this Friday that involves each employee being separated into departmental teams, which is problematic because the department that I was previously a part of no longer exists. It's the most important event of the year for our company and attendance is absolutely mandatory. Of course you can miss it if you're sick or have a personal matter, but due to a fair number of  people calling in sick at last year's event all employee absences will be reviewed and verified by HR, and they will conduct in-person interviews if necessary. I cannot attract even the smallest amount of attention from HR without risking being discovered as a corporate leech so I don't think calling in sick is an option. However, I can't participate in the team building exercises without it being discovered that I'm not currently assigned to any department and I'm in a state of perpetually paid limbo. 

The best idea that I've come up with so far is to come the picnic with crutches and pretend that I've sprained my ankle or something, so I can fulfill the attendance requirement and just watch the team building exercises and not take part of them (based on the itinerary most of the events are active and involve being on your feet), but then again doing this will attract attention to myself which is a very bad thing when management and HR are around.

And even though jobs are now scarce, I hate (and hesitate) to return to any organization that is purely profits-based and doesn't care about me as a person, or my financial stability.

But that’s capitalism, right? Here’s what I really can’t swallow: With the personal stimulus (which I know is ending, but hopefully will be resolved), I’m making more with unemployment/COVID pay than at my heavily-taxed, $60k a year job. Whenever I go back to work — again, now with seven years experience and at a mid-tier position — is it unreasonable to ask for higher compensation, citing these COVID benefits?

That’s probably an unrealistic expectation. Which is why I can't see myself returning to the workforce — it’s totally broken. I don't want to be taken advantage of by a faceless corporation, just to be cut off without warning, left without a security blanket. 

Thank God I don't have to support a family. (But seriously — do most millennials even WANT children? It’s hard enough providing for ourselves.)

Just to give everyone some context, the selection process for this job took MONTHS and at one point I called the person in charge of the process  and told her that I wouldn’t be participating in the selection process anymore because it was taking too long, that my boss was starting to get suspicious because the interviews for this job took 3 hours of my day 2 days a week and when you ask for “personal time” every week it gets a little suspicious and that I know that in this kind of processes   they have probably 1000 applicants I for sure knew that I wasn’t going to get the job so I wished to withdraw my participation, anyway the lady told me that I was the best candidate and that I was probably gonna get the job so I stayed in the process.

And after another 2 months of interviews I was rejected today and when the HR lady called me to give me the news I lost it for the first time in my life, she told me 3 things that made me unload everything on her:

First, she told me “we will keep your CV in our documents for future positions” and basically told her that I know that my CV was going to be put on her drawer never to be seeing again and that she did not need to sugarcoated me. 

Second, she said that she was going to give me some feedback on the process so I can put it  on my CV and I totally said to her that who would put the ""positive"" feedback of a selection process of a job that I was rejected on my CV? 

Lastly, she told me that I should send an email to everyone on the HR team to thank them for the selection process and literally I told her: Oh and what should I say them? Thanks for rejecting me best wishes everyone?

And the cherry on top? THEY WANT TO USE MY PICTURES TO PROMOTE THE SELECTION PROCESS, I told her that she did not have my permission to this because this could seriously affect me at my actual job and she told me that the ""other candidates"" were honored they were asked this and accept it without question.

This was all on the phone and this lady does not work directly for the company, she works for an outsourcing for this selection process.

I just lost it guys, I know it was unprofessional but it made me so angry THEY CANNOT WASTE MY TIME LIKE THIS EVEN WHEN OPENLY DECLARED THAT DID NOT WISH TO PARTICIPATE JUST TO AVOID ALL THIS.

Thank you to everyone who commented on my previous post, your comments gave me some more motivation to look for another job before I inevitably get discovered and fired. That being said, I have not been able find another real job as of yet but I have gone for several interviews so that's promising.

Anyways on to the good bit. Its been almost 3 weeks since my last post and I have still gone completely unnoticed by everyone which is simultaneously a relief and really depressing. It's the lack responsibility and purpose that's becoming increasingly maddening. Similar to [u/notdoingshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/38f0dw/i_dont_do_shit_at_work/), I have discovered that not doing anything all day is worse than actually doing some work. Playing video games and surfing the web all day don't make the days go by faster anymore. Therefore, in the past week I have started working under the table for my aunt when I'm in the office instead of sitting there and doing nothing. I know this is a very ethically dubious thing to do but the money's good and it's helping me pay off my debts.

Some background, my aunt runs a small specialty store by herself and receives a lot of email inquiries that she can barely keep up with. She knew about my situation and asked me to help her respond to these emails. Basically all her emails are forwarded to a gmail account I setup and I spend probably 3-4 hours everyday responding to inquiries and forwarding relevant ones to my aunt. Doing this is helping me to stay sane as well as padding my wallet ($400 a week). I have asked her and she can't afford to pay me full time and I can't afford to work part time, so I can't leave my job unless I find another decent full time job, which I'm still looking for. I know that I will most likely be discovered at the end September during the quarterly review, but if I have to I'm gonna hold on to the very end.

I just wanted to share how I have descended deeper into the rabbit hole. I will welcome any comments or suggestions that you guys have about my situation. ",1438913147.0,2015-08-06 22:05:47

Unless you are hiring for a senior, executive, or maybe manager position... please stop requiring every job above minimum wage to already have 3-10 years experience in that exact field.

Only older generations are eligible for these jobs because of it (and because they got these jobs easier when these years-to-qualify factor wasn’t so common).

It’s so unfair to qualified (as in meets all other job requirements such as the college degree and skills required) millennials struggling on minimum wage straight out of college because you require years of experience for something college already prepared and qualified us for. 

And don’t call us whiners for calling it unfair when I know for a fact boomers got similar jobs to today straight out of college. Employers are not being fair to the last decade of college graduates by doing this. Most of these employers themselves got their job way back when such specific experience wasn’t a factor.

And to add onto this:
Employers that require any college degree for a job but only pay that job minimum wage are depressingly laughable. That is saying your want someone’s college skills but you don’t think they deserve to be able to pay off their student debt.

This is why millennials are struggling.
You people make it so most of us HAVE to struggle. Stop telling us we aren’t trying hard enough when your rules literally make it impossible for us to even get started.

We cannot use our degrees to work and earn more money if you won’t even let us get started.

THAT is why so many people are struggling and why so many of us are depressed. Being five years out of college, still working minimum wage, because a job won’t hire you because you don’t already have experience for the job you’re completely otherwise qualified for.

96,Quitting a job feels like breaking up from an unhappy relationship,920,iorygf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iorygf/quitting_a_job_feels_like_breaking_up_from_an/,78,"I’ve been unhappy for over a year and the last time I tried to quit my managers talked me out of it so I stayed for another 6 months. But the toxic environment has taken a huge toll on my mental and physical well being. I feel guilty, and keep playing in my head over and over again about leaving my boss high and dry, what will she do without me, what will happen to me? Will I find another job will I be happy again? This totally feels like leaving an unhappy relationship. 

I took a week vacation and during this time I emotionally detached from my job and relationships with my colleagues to make my exit easier. I turned off my work phone and gave one word replies when my colleagues sent me personal texts (we are friends and hang out outside of work). I made this decision not out of anger or stress. Instead I’ve never been more relaxed during this time so I know this decision is well thought out and not a rash one. I know if I continue at this job I’ll just grow complacent and live with the stress. Life is short and I refuse to put myself last anymore. 

I’m going to work up the courage to submit my resignation today. I hope I stick to my guns and go through with it. Not sure what the future holds but Wish me luck.

UPDATE: thanks for all the comments and encouragement. Some of you have asked for an update. So I waited until almost the end of the day when things slowed down a bit to approach my boss. I gave her my resignation and again, like a relationship, she made me feel guilty for leaving, said not many options out there right now, she loves working with me, don’t leave etc. For a second I questioned myself again but in the end I stuck to my decision. As for not having another job lined up, I’m actively seeking and because I’ve been miserable for so long, I’ve actually been planning my exit for a while and have at least 3 months cushion to fall back on. Me quitting was calculated and not a rash decision, I just had to wait until the time is right but realized there is no perfect time when I continue to watch my health deteriorate and my world collapse (because the stress has affected every aspect of my life). I’m well aware not everyone’s situation is the same and not everyone can afford to quit. I’m still taking a risk, but I have to do what’s best for me. I honestly feel the weight has been literally lifted off my shoulders. I gave them 2.5 weeks notice and will be out by end of the month. I send good luck to everyone who is in the same boat as I am. If you can quit, do it. Don’t let anyone guilt trip you. Don’t waste your life away being miserable or you won’t live long enough to enjoy it anyway.",1599593752.0,2020-09-08 15:35:52

The owner of the company seemed friendly and straightforward during the interview, and I got offered the job on the spot. I started working today, and I had to leave after less than two hours. The first red flag was that they did not have me fill out any new hire paperwork and told me that they do not have direct deposit. The second red flag was that I was told by the owner that I was actually going to start out as a sales associate for 18 dollars an hour and that the managerial position was going to be filled ""as needed."" The third red flag was that he told me that they did not offer commission until my ""probationary period"" ended ""when they felt like I was ready."" The fourth red flag was when the owner told me that the previous two employees that they fired were ""shitbags"" and that he hoped I would be better. The final red flag was that the backroom of the store was a complete disaster of boxes and papers strewn everywhere, and I saw two rats scurry by when the owner turned the lights on. The owner told me that my first task was going to be to move an entire shelf of extremely heavy boxes to another shelf at the other end of the warehouse, and then promptly went into his office. I looked through the window and saw him on YouTube watching car vidoes. I started moving the boxes around and another rat scurried past my feet. At that point, I put the boxes down, punched out, and left without a single word to the owner.

I started feeling hopeless and desperate, but decided that I had to keep going, however at the same time, I decided to give myself a break and spend some time doing things I would enjoy and even learned a little about photoshop.

105,Switched up my application technique. Went from getting interviews 14% of the time to 88% of the time,895,81aei9,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/81aei9/switched_up_my_application_technique_went_from/,192,"I'm hoping this can be helpful to some of the job searchers out there.

Last summer my company shut down and I got laid off. The next month I moved halfway across the country and felt confident I could find a job in a few weeks. I had been looking at jobs in my new city for a while.

I was applying on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, AngelList and company websites. I was writing cover letters and sending in resumes daily. There were jobs I was perfect for and my background proved it. I wasn't getting many interviews and when I did, it was usually just the first round. **At this point I was getting an interview 14% of the time.**

I blamed my resume. I spent time obsessing over little details and adding experience. No change in interviews.

Then I decided that if it really was all about who you know, I needed to get to know the right people. From then on I decided that if I liked the sound of a job I would find someone there, meet them and ask them to refer me.

I stopped applying to jobs on the website. I asked old bosses for introductions. I asked friends from school for introductions. I asked people I had just been introduced to for introductions. I met people for coffee and went to Meetups. Some of them didn't pan out, but a lot of them put me in touch with people who ended up referring me.

**When someone referred me to a position I got an interview 88% of the time.** People love referrals because they get to do someone a favor and because sometimes their company will pay them for a successful hire. Recruiters trust referrals and it makes them read your resume from a perspective of trying to *qualify* you instead of *disqualify* you.

I'm a big data nerd so I put together a bunch of charts and wrote out my full story here:
https://medium.com/@max.milhan/how-i-got-5x-the-interviews-and-four-job-offers-in-a-city-where-i-didnt-know-anyone-1cb078996fe1

**So here's my suggestion for how to get in touch with people and get referred into jobs instead of applying:**

* Find a job you're interested in that you could be a good fit for. If you're a fit for 70% of the job requirements that's probably okay
* Don't apply for it immediately. It's tempting but if you do it will actually reduce your chances later on. If I applied first without a referral I got an interview 14% of the time. If I applied and then got a referral it only went up to 17% of the time. This is because the recruiter may have already looked at my resume and rejected me and they usually won't take a second look just because someone referred me.
* Instead, look up the company page on LinkedIn and click 'See all employees on LinkedIn'
* Look for 1st or 2nd degree connections. Do not trust the LinkedIn filter for 2nd or 3rd degree connections. For some reason I found that the filter would show nobody as a 2nd degree connection but if I scrolled through the pages I would find several 2nd degree connections.
* If you have a 1st degree connection, send them a message. ""Hey [friend, old coworker, childhood nemesis]! I've been looking around at new jobs and see that you're working at [company]. Can I buy you a coffee and pick your brain about it a bit? I can meet you somewhere close to your office so it's easy for you. Any days next week work well?""
* If you have a 2nd degree connection, send your existing friend a message. ""Hey, it's been a while since we talked, I hope that [something you know about them] is going well! I'm looking for a new job and saw that you know [person] at [company]. I'd love to get in touch with them and figure out what it's like working there. Do you know them well enough to put me in touch? If it's helpful I can email you a quick intro blurb about me that you can just forward on to them.""
* If you absolutely can't find someone you know at a company, go ahead and apply for it normally.
* Here's the priority order of people to reach out to. People who would be your peers (most relevant discussion, most relevant possible referral) -> the hiring manager for the role you want (most relevant discussion) -> sales people (always open to networking) -> anybody else (hey, there's a chance they can introduce you to the people above) -> recruiters (used to being annoyed by job seekers, actively trying to filter out candidates).
* Figure out some questions you have about the company that don't have the answer somewhere on their website. ""What do you think about what [competitor] is doing?"" or ""I saw in the news that you just launched [new product]. Where did the idea for that come from?"" or ""How do you guys usually handle [thing related to the job you want]?"" Focus on questions that are related to the role you want to do so that you have knowledge you can use in interviews later.
* Meet the person for coffee or over the phone. Ask your intelligent questions. Be interested in what they do and their company. You're 1) having a nice, social conversation, 2) showing them that you're smart / interested and 3) having them like you enough to root for you. Try not to bring up the job until they do or until you have about 5 minutes left. They'll usually ask how they can help you.
* Mention that you saw a role and that you think you'd be a good fit for it because of [reason, reason, reason]. If the rest of the conversation went well they'll usually offer to refer you. If they don't, ask things like ""Do you know who I could get in touch with about that role? Do you know who might be the hiring manager for it?"" Send the resume along.

It’s been four days since this all started and a lot happened since then. The owner came in this week and talked with both the AGM and my wife separately to ask them about the current GM while he’s out of town on vacation. They’ve officially decided between their opinions as well as the staff surveys that are flooding them with horror stories about him that he will be terminated when he returns. The current AGM, who is friends with my wife and who my wife works well with, will become the GM. My wife will become the AGM, which is the position she really wanted anyways, and she’ll get both the raise and benefits too. She was even smart enough to have the owner sign a contract guaranteeing her the position and the new salary. Her two biggest problems were being underpaid and unappreciated as a result of the way the GM treated her. Now that all of this is being fixed, she doesn’t feel the desire to leave anymore. Plus, being the AGM as opposed to moving to another service manager position will give her the opportunity to apply for GM at another restaurant when she does decide to leave.

Edit: Also thought it was worth mentioning that while the AGM was on her vacation, the GM scheduled my wife to pick up every single extra shift and picked up none himself. The owner found this out as well and is writing a check for a few hundred to reimburse her for the extra hours that week.",1561837529.0,2019-06-29 15:45:29

You have extra time on your hands. Exercise gives you a sense of accomplishment and uplifts your mood. If possible, club it with job applications to make it a habit. For example, send out 3 applications right after 30 minutes of exercise. Pick up something easy (running, biking, bodyweight exercises), start small. The returns in the long run are huge, both mentally and physically. 

I say this as someone who recently got back on the employment train and now finds it difficult to do anything fitness related consistently.

There is also specific job hunting advice here (question #1) that's the best I can give.

---

**Without further ado, here are my Top 10-ish Resume FAQs:**

#**1. Nice. Thanks for the resume. Now how do I go about *finding a job*?**

- Search jobs on [AngelList](https://angel.co/) (make a terrific, full AngelList profile first), LinkedIn, ​Glassdoor, ​and StackOverflow. Those are the best sites.

- Make a Hired.com profile and mark all the cities you're willing to work in. I could post my personal referral link to Hired here, but I won't because that feels weird, but let me know if you want it.

- Make sure your LinkedIn profile is spruced up and filled out so you get poached by recruiters. ​You should put your technical skills in the skills section (recruiters use a lot of keywords and boolean search strings when hunting).

- Find a recruiter in the industry you want to be in and maybe reach out to them, or apply to jobs on a recruiter's website vs directly on a company's website. It's in a recruiter's best interest to get you hired, so it's always nice to have a direct path to the hiring manager and a financially motivated advocate on your side.

- Also apply for jobs on your college's job board. I know it may seem weird, but the companies advertising there are​ already​ looking for ​[your school's] grads. There will likely be senior roles listed alongside entry-level roles.

- In any applicant email or cover letter, make sure it's not cookie-cutter. Write them all from scratch. Templated cover letters are a bad look. They only have to be like a paragraph and should match the tone of the company's culture.

- When you get down to the nitty gritty, make the hiring manager's life as easy as possible. You want them to say ""yes.""

 - “When can you start?"" -> ""When do you need me to start? ​...​Sounds good."" (Unless there's a huge problem.)

 - “How much money do you want?"" -> ""Well salary is important to me​ because I'm looking at owning a home and setting up roots here, so it'll definitely be a component of wherever I decide to go, but first and foremost I'm looking for a job that I'll be happy in and that I think advances my career to where I want to be in the long term."" Make them give you the first number; they should be able to tell you the job's range.

 - “If they push on salary, it's very easy to say, ""Well, I wouldn't consider the job for less than X, and I'd likely make the move for Y, and I'd be thrilled to come to work every day for Z."" You want them to give you a number in between Y and Z. Don't give them only X because it's the bare minimum you'd work for. Give them multiple choices and make them choose.

- Use Glassdoor.com to apply to jobs and prep for interviews – most jobs at big companies have all the interview questions on there already.

  - Make sure you know 95% of the questions coming at you before they're asked.

#**2. How do I explain away a gap in my work history on my resume?**

It's ok to have a job on your resume that says:

Company: **Independent Consultant**

Role: *[X] Consulting for Multiple Clients*

Dates: *Year last worked elsewhere - Present*

Then just have one bullet point that says, ""Needed scheduling flexibility to take care of some personal matters, so I worked as an [independent consultant] for a year.""

If you don't have *any* side work during your time off, just have a bullet point under your last job (very last bullet point) that says ""Needed scheduling flexibility to take care of personal family matters, which is why I left this role.""

No one will ask about the personal matters, and you can just handwave it away as ""Some family items that needed to be sorted out"" if they do. That way, you don't have to explain why you took a break in the rat race, and you can phrase it as ""but now I'm ready to jump back into a full-time position in the area I'm most experienced in and enjoy the most."" Don't feel the need to over-compensate for the gap -- people value simplicity and like it when people are straightforward, and they don't like overdone bullet points or long-winded explantations by phone. 10 seconds or less during the interview, move on, excited and ready for the new gig.

#**3. Are cover letters useful?**

[Not if your resume is bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/dueht7p/). They can be a nice differentiator if your resume is good.

Unless it's required, I wouldn't write any type of long formal cover letter. They won't read it unless your resume is strong and they already think you can do the job.

I'll put it this way: your cover letter can't save you from a bad resume. If the resume is bad, they'll skip reading whatever letter you wrote. If your resume is good, a nice, short, original (never cookie-cutter), company-specific letter can improve your odds, separate you from similar applicants, and make a great first impression.

The best cover letters are short (1 paragraph), written from scratch, and have the same tone as the company's culture.

---

#**4. How do I move horizontally in my career (i.e., make a career switch)? Should I embellish my current experience as a front desk person?**

I wouldn't gussy things up on the resume. Don't try to make a non-glamorous job sound like anything other than what it is. Describe it quickly: are you a bartender? Put ""Tend bar full-time at local restaurant that can require 60+ hour work weeks."" You can show you're a hard worker, but you don't need to say things like, ""Provide outstanding and exemplary customer experience in a top-10 Austin fine dining establishment.""

People tend to embellish on resumes to compensate for what they view as bad experience, but I advise people to lean into it; otherwise, you can't confidently talk about what you've done in the past.

You'll want to look at job descriptions online in your experience range (i.e., # of years in the workforce) for companies you want to work for, look at the skills they require, and then go learn them before applying. Maybe do some side projects. I'm talking skills that can be learned in a month - Google AdWords, Amazon AMS, Google Analytics, Shopify website design and marketing, Facebook marketing, Instagram marketing, viral marketing on reddit, etc. Look at sales jobs, biz dev jobs, marketing jobs, customer service – those are all more lenient to people with differing backgrounds. You'll have to get at least 1-2 years of a good company name or good experience on your resume before you ""move up"" to a dream job or a non-monotonous job.

If you like graphic design, take some Adobe Creative Cloud courses on Udemy and build a portfolio of projects on Fiverrr.

If you want to move into programming, use Codecademy, G School, General Assembly, or another program like that (some cost $$, some don't, all are around 3 - 9 months long to learn any type of useful programming skill that looks good on a resume). Do as much coding as you can in your spare time on public projects and include your Github profile as a link on your resume.

Also, look at startup jobs on AngelList – startups are a little more lenient when it comes to hiring people from various backgrounds.

Stuff like that will go a long way towards a career trajectory shift.

A lot of people put objectives that say they want to make a career change, but honestly... I don't know if an objective will help here. If you applied for a job that's an obvious career change, the screener will see that and know that. You're either qualified or not, and I find objectives that say, ""I'm looking to make a change"" or something like that come off as a little desperate. I prefer someone be confident and just apply to the job with a normal resume without any explanations – you shouldn't hope to get passed through for a job you're not qualified for, and an objective won't change that. I would focus more on side and freelance projects in the field to show that you have at least some relevant experience or deep interest in the field.

#**5. I've had multiple roles within my last company / I'm a consultant and I work a bunch of temp jobs. How do I show this in a good way?**

For multiple roles, do this:

**Company Name** [spacing to align right] **Year Started at company - Present**

*Various [Job Function] Roles and Promotions* [spacing to align right] *City, State*

*Current Role* [spacing to align right] *Year started in role - Present*

- Bullet 1

- Bullet 2

*Prior role* [spacing to align right] *Year started in prior role - Year role changed*

- Bullet 1 

- Bullet 2

Then rinse and repeat until you have all roles outlined. If gives you continuity up top at first glance (""ok they've been at the same company for a while"") while still showing your upwards trajectory or all the hats you've worn.

For **temp jobs,** thing to do is just put it on the resume as normal in my template - 

**Company Name**

*Position Name*

Last bullet point after responsibilities and accomplishments:

* Temporary placement via [Name] staffing agency

If you have a ton of temp placements, I would structure it like this:

 **Staffing Agency**            [alignment spacing]   **Overall Date - Date**

*Most Recent Placement*  [alignment spacing]   *Date - Date*

* Bullet Points

*Prior Placement*  [alignment spacing]   *Date - Date*

* Bullet Points

*Prior Placement*  [alignment spacing]   *Date - Date*

* Bullet Points

So that way in bold, it looks like you have continuity, and then in italics you explain where you've been at each temp stop.

#**6. A one page resume doesn't leave enough room for my 20-year-long work history. What can I do?**

Good [comment chain here](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/dufntpn/) about this. Excerpt:

Parse down by trimming bullet points to just 1 or 2 per past job, remove most of the stuff under education aside from your degree and school name, and reduce the font to 8pt and widen the margins. Definitely don't remove past positions unless you put a catch all like putting ""Various Companies and IT Positions"" for the first 10 years after you graduated school, and then list out the companies (with the role in parentheses next to each company) as the bullet point. So you can display the last 10-15 years fully, but then truncate the first 5-10 years of your career that may not be as relevant at this point.

---

#**7. I didn't complete college. How do I show that in a good way?**

Without knowing your specific situation to give exact advice, I would follow my resume format (but move **Education** below **Skills & Interests** so you can first show your chops) and set it up as such:

**College Name** [spacing to align right] **Year Start - Year You Left**

*Major: ______* [spacing to align right] *Location*

* Relevant coursework: ___ , ___ , ___ , ___ , ___

* Left college prior to graduation in order to pursue my career.

---

#**8. How can I 100% get through an ATS automatic screening system?**

Don't think about it like this. You might get past the initial screen, but you may harm your chances of actually getting the job, even if qualified. If you list too many or unrelated skills, people will think you're full of shit as soon as they get human eyes on that resume haha. I'd list a decent amount of skills you're confident you have that also match up with what they're looking for in the job description, but don't just throw spaghetti at the wall and see what sticks.

---

#**9. I'm 16. How do resume? Can I job?**

You're young! Go walk into somewhere and ask if they're hiring and fill out an application, or go on their website and apply. Restaurants and retail are your best friends. You can use my resume format; it will just have a lot more whitespace! Add a volunteering section, list your high school under Education, student clubs, sports, extracurriculars, etc.

#**9a. I'm interviewing for my first job out of college. Any advice?**

- When they ask what your biggest weakness is, give an honest response. Don't say that you work too hard, or that you're a perfectionist. That's BS. Talk about a time that it's bitten you, what you're doing to try to overcome it, and an example of how you've been making sure you stay conscious of your weaknesses and work around it.

- Be professional but also yourself. You're young, so they'll wonder about your work ethic, emotional maturity, and ability to handle adversity. I'd keep that in mind and stay centered, don't get flustered, but also crack a joke or two at the right time and make sure they know you're also someone they'd like spending time with every day.

- Negotiate salary by phone, and then follow up via email. Don't. Negotiate. Over. Email. Things will get lost in translation and you can lose an offer if you're not careful at this stage. Always negotiate by phone (also negotiate more than salary – bonuses, parking, fringe benefits if any, vacation policy (if flexible, don't push if not), that sort of thing.

- Don't burn any bridges, ever. If you ever get rejected, take it in stride, and never say anything (especially in writing) that you can't take back.

#**10. I want to relocate. How can I apply for jobs in different cities without being at a disadvantage for living out of town?**

Instead of your current city, or alongside it, put ""Moving to: City, State"" at the top of your resume for whichever location you're applying to so they know that you're already dead-set on relocation.

#**11. How do I discuss reasons for leaving a job in an interview?**

123,Word of advice: don't trust HR. I did and regret it!,853,jm6ici,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jm6ici/word_of_advice_dont_trust_hr_i_did_and_regret_it/,140,"A lil background: I began working at an auto plant about 2 months ago and was even placed into a preferred position. Things were going great and I thought they were going to keep me around. Occasionally new people would be moved to different departments but it was generally for disciplinary reasons. Regardless, I felt confident because I was always on time, never missed a day, no write-ups, and did what I was told without complaining. 

Since they drug test frequently, I thought it'd make sense to go by HR and discuss somethings that was bothering me. That was my first mistake—I got cocky and assumed I could confide with HR. Don't. They are not your friends.

Most large companies don't care about you as an individual, they care that they can make a profit off of your work. If you describe yourself as a liability, you're likely to be moved or let go. Doesn't matter why. I learned this the hard way when I went to HR and talked about my prescribed medications in confidence. I know they randomly drug test and because I'm on ADHD meds, I wanted to get ahead of the situation. I know there's a possibility of testing positive for amphetamines with my meds. I mentioned my concerns and they said to keep my bottles on me just in case, but not to worry. Turns out, that was a lie.

Long story short: I started my day in a preferred department and went to HR during lunch to confided something about prescribed medications. By the end of lunch I was moved and working assembly doing a shit job for the same pay, but less benefits. 

Take my advice and learn from my mistake; never go to HR unless it's specifically related to work. And even so, make sure it doesn't incriminate you in any possible way. Even if it's medically related, large companies DO. NOT. CARE. ABOUT. YOU. Thanks for reading my rant, cheers 👌",1604281766.0,2020-11-01 20:49:26
124,I didn't realize how much I was doing while I was unemployed.,850,bsgg7m,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bsgg7m/i_didnt_realize_how_much_i_was_doing_while_i_was/,61,"I was unemployed for several months. I live with partner and he was taking on the majority of the *finances. My parents also sent me money once a month. Like many of you I felt deeply ashamed.

I started working a month ago. Within two weeks our household fell apart. I'm not one to hold cleaning to high standards. At least I don't think I am. With both us being tired at the end of a work day, me going to bed early to try and correct my sleep cycle, and us having busy weekends outside of our house visiting family, the laundry wasn't getting done (we've both had instances of having to wear underwear from the rag bin because none was clean, and nearing the end of unprofessional clothing to wear for work). Dinners have been a but on the fly without me to make a grocery list. Even though we both like to make a ""date"" of shopping at the grocery store together. The floors weren't as shiney and there were little things out everywhere instead of being put neatly in their place. My partner is not lazy about cleaning, he's just used to me having it done by the time he gets home and the weekend rolls around. Little ""administrative"" things like making phone calls about medical appointments and other errands are getting harder to keep up with. A lot of things in our area close about 5-6 pm, both of our jobs can sometimes run over time. I also uses to help our neighbors out when their work ran late. Not anymore.

The fact that I hate my new job makes all of this even more frustrating!

What I'm trying to say for anyone unemployed and feeling down, you aren't worthless. Keeping your household running is a job in itself. If you have time to deep clean things or do projects that require long term planning, take this time! Do not get down yourself. Not all contributions are financial. Between scouring boards and making up applications (which is fucking exhausting within itself) do some chores to boost your mood.

I've been job searching in a new town since January and it's been....demoralizing at best. Dozens of applications out, with only a quarter of them bringing back interviews. Of those interviews, I've gotten close to one offer.  On the verge of a mental breakdown last week, I bought some grass seeds on impulse, planted them this weekend and there are sprouts everywhere! Every time I check back, there are more --- the complete opposite of my inbox! It might sound stupid and cheesy, but it's done wonders for my mental health.

130,How I helped a 16 year old land a job,832,atj9hs,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/atj9hs/how_i_helped_a_16_year_old_land_a_job/,55,"Let's not sugar coat this. Finding a job nowadays is not easy even for us adults. So when I was approached by a 16 year old looking for his first job, I really wanted to help. He had put out over a dozen different applications from anything from Pizza crew to bag boy. He was only granted one interview and they never called him. He is a good well mannered boy so I did not really see why he could not land a little part time job somewhere. His biggest hold back was NO EXPERIENCE but how are you supposed to get experience if no one will hire you.

So I came up with an idea.

First I had him go to [redcross.org](https://redcross.org) and paid for him ($30) to take the Adult CPR/AED online class. This did a couple of things. It made him stand out because not many young people have that certification. Shows that he is serious and trying to learn skills. This also is a prerequisite to getting a summer job like a life guard or etc.

Second I had him go to [https://www.servsafe.com/ServSafe-Food-Handler](https://www.servsafe.com/ServSafe-Food-Handler) and paid for him ($15) to take the Servsafe Food Handler Certification. This is a certification that teaches you how to handle food safely, about cross contamination and how to properly store foods. Perfect certification for a restaurant.

He place two more applications that week and listed the certifications on his resume. First store (pizza place) granted him an interview, but no call back. Second place (higher end restaurant) granted him an interview and hired him immediately as a dish washer. Two weeks later he was trained as a bus boy and working on training for Breader (person in the kitchen applying bread coating to foods that are fried). After a little bit more training he will be moved primarily to Breader. The cooks say that he is a good breader because he can keep up with them. He is still making minimum wage but is working about 20 to 24 hours a week and not having to sling dishes after only about 3 weeks on the job. For a 16 year old, that ain't bad.

I had a post-hire chat with him. Come to find out that no one in the restaurant except the manager even had a Servsafe certification of any kind and when the managers saw that they said that made them want to hire him immediately.

Personal note. I did not ask the young man to pay me back anything but he paid the $45 back to me $15 a week. This shows strength of character. Employers like character.

&#x200B;

Update: Thank you so much for the positive feed back. It is my hope that this will help some other young person with their first job as well. Several people have added even more good ideas in the comments below. I did want to stop and thank all of you for the up votes.

&#x200B;

Follow up: (4 weeks in) The young man has stayed at it. So far has cleared over $400 his first month and has been moved from full time dishwasher to ""Breader"" working directly with the kitchen staff prepping food before cooking. (No raise for that but an easier position.) He beat out another young man that they hired for that position. The cooks said that he was able to keep up with them better. I congratulated him and counseled him on keeping the job as long as he can before football season this next year (this will make it easier to be hired on his next job) and to save a portion of each pay check (at least 10%) which he has been successful at (to pay for gas and etc during the season). He set a goal of $400 saved to last him the season until he can start work again.",1550880170.0,2019-02-22 19:02:50

anyways, i was obviously super upset. but, i updated my resume, printed out 7 and set out to find work. i live in a city, so theres stores and restaurants everywhere within walking distance. 

i went back home once i got rid of those 7 resumes. i was home for about 10 minutes before something inside me said, go try again. 

so, i printed 10 more, and set out again to find work. well, first place i walked into interviewed me on the spot, and after about twenty minutes i was filling out forms for an employee backround check. 

also, the job i got today is a lot better than my last one. way more benefits, a useful discount, ft employment, and within walking distance of home.

i encourage everyone who is trying to find jobs to set out and walk in to places with your resume. if i had applied online i probably would have had to wait months

edit: i’ve unfortunately seen a few comments about how you SHOULDNT go and try to hand in resumes in person. 

first of all, way to go reddit for making a positive story— one which was meant to give other redditors hope and encouragement, a negative thing. sad, but its the internet so not much is expected.

second, please note that i posted this in jobs, mentioned i was working retail, and that the places i was walking into with my resume were all restaurants & stores (as mentioned), meaning, low paying, entry level, no prior experience/ education needed kinds of places. this method probably wont work for those of you looking to take the next step in your CAREERS, or looking for employment that isnt minimum wage or willing to hire college and high school students. i didnt think this was something, i’d have to point out, but nonetheless many took my story, seemed to skim major details about the jobs i was applying for,  and ran with it to comment something snarky

and third, thank you to everyone who has congratulated me. i had no idea this post would get so much attention! thank you everyone for your kind words! i wish everyone the best in finding a job, whether it is a low skill one or not, i wish everyone luck. thank you!",1563357638.0,2019-07-17 06:00:38

133,I just withdrew from consideration from a job after a ridiculous interview.,826,8qmmfu,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8qmmfu/i_just_withdrew_from_consideration_from_a_job/,162,"This interview was for a content creator/writer position at an accounting company. It's decided to bring marketing in\-house, as many do when they reach a certain size, and believe in educating their audience. Considering the complex topic and opportunity within the space *for* a company to become a thoughtleader in cloud\-based accounting techniques, it seems a smart move and a great place to start something from the ground up.

During the first interview:

* The CEO/Founder (henceforce CEO) insisted on meeting with me before the Marketing Director, my actual boss. Weird, but fine.
* The CEO had clearly never actually read any of my samples or my resume before the meeting, which, again, happens, even if it's not ideal.
* CEO harps on semantics of when, exactly, I received my degree, implying that I'm a newbie professional when I've been working full\-time in my field for nigh on seven years.
* CEO then tells me that ""no one actually reads anymore"" for an advertised *writer* position, and that they're really looking to create podcasts and videos ...  and blogs because you kinda have to. That's... great for them, but definitely not in the job description.
* CEO asks me where I see myself in five years; I said in management and strategy, and less of the day\-to\-day, but I need more experience in managing people before I can make that move. He agrees, saying a ""girl"" of my experience was definitely unprepared for that.

(... Hold the phone. Bitch, this ain't my first marketing rodeo. I've gotten solid numbers behind my results that no newbie can make\-\-certainly few greenies straight from college could achieve them. My work is *damned* solid and been published in industry publications. Personally, my husband and I are trying for children, we own our own house, and I'm responsible for bills and shit. I am *a wom*an, not a ""girl,"" and if you do a condescending eyeroll one more time, I'm going to throw this waterbottle your secretary got me at your forehead.)

It was at this point I began to feel my polite smile grow brittle.

After some other conversation about strengths and weaknesses, he asked if I had any questions. When I asked him why bring it in house, and why do content marketing, he couldn't articulate why heading in that direction was the best way. I could tell him, of course, but his inability to explain the move meant I'd be fighting both directions.

Praying that my actual potential boss might redeem the interview, I got up when he went to check on whether the marketing director (MD) was ready for me and held out my hand. He didn't shake it.

During the second interview:

* The MD was a genuinely lovely and warm person. Reminded me of my mom, actually, and set me at ease.
* MD had read all of my documentation, exempting a marketing video script they'd specifically requested I send over even after I'd mentioned that video script writing\-\-while I'd done it\-\-was not in my wheelhouse. I spent Monday afternoon researching and writing one tailored to be a general business\-centric introduction.
* MD was generally worshipful of the CEO, and could also not quite explain the shift to marketing in a content marketing style, though mentioned that the company's overall culture was one of education.
* MD tried to explain away CEO's dismissal of writing and reading when I asked her if she agreed that ""no one reads anymore,"" saying that she was sure that he just meant that people dismiss writing if it's not immediately pertinent to them. (That was not, in fact, what he believed.)
* I had to explain what ""nebulous"" meant. It's been years since I talked like a dictionary to people I don't know, but I'd have expected a MD\-\-especially one currently serving as the in\-house writer\-\-to know what that word means. I laughed it off with her, saying I'd mispronounced ""reticent"" for years until my husband corrected me, but her eyes got a bit glassy. I'm not sure she knew what that meant, either.
* MD couldn't talk to me about future campaigns she was excited about, or the performance of previous campaigns. She could barely talk to me about her favorite project to date, which turned out to be a blog post.
* MD claimed that sales and marketing were completely, 100&#37; aligned and there was no friction. This is a complete falsehood; marketing and sales always butt heads, especially when they're both so new.
* When I asked about full\-cycle marketing that includes customer retention and upselling, in addition to lead generation, the MD blinked, umm'd a few times, then hurriedly assured me that that was certainly something in their wheelhouse, too. I declined to press further.

There was more, I'm sure, but I can't remember it over the memory of my ears ringing.

I sent the following message to their recruiter who had reached out to me:

>Hi, Recruiter! Thank you so much for passing my information along. MD was wonderful to speak with\-\-hopefully she had a chance to enjoy the outside today!  
>  
>However, on further reflection during my ride home, I feel I must withdraw my application from further consideration. I feel uncomfortable pursuing a writer position at a company whose founder apparently feels that no one reads anymore, and refers to a candidate as ""girl"" when responding to stated career plans.  
>  
>I sincerely hope you find a wonderful content creator during your search; it's a fantastic opportunity, and I've yet to meet a hiring manager as genuine and pleasant as MD.  
>  
>Please let me know if there's anything more I can do for you, on this position or others.  
>  
>Sincerely, TerribleHashtags

The recruiter has since responded that she will withdraw my app, thank you for the feedback, and good luck with your search.

... I just finished a (I thought solid!) phone interview with a Fortune\-100 bank this morning. I spoke on the phone with a branch of a major television channel yesterday, and will be invited back for an in\-person we're still hammering out. A lovely agency doing federal department work contacted references for me yesterday (which apparently went well), and I'll be meeting them for a second interview tomorrow.

I don't need to take your shit, you condescending bastard who apparently hires people with spines consisting of weak noodles that merely nod in his presence.

I pity the poor content creator who has to work with that pissant.

(... thanks. I feel better for ranting now.)

When I come home, it's hard to muster up the willpower to do much of anything, and it's becoming easier than ever to succumb to methods of instant gratification: like eating junk food as opposed to a healthy meal or watching TV instead of exercising. It's just like the rest of the day is so unsatisfying, I need to ingest something that might make me feel good for just a little bit.

What's worse is I feel like everyone else but me is more than okay with the state of things. They will more than gladly work overtime just to prove their worth. I feel like a sack of shit because I think just working the normal hours are way too much. I feel like I'm just going to burnout at some point and not do anything.

But even if I don't want to work overtime, it's hard to just ignore people trying to contact me after-hours. It's an 8:00-5:00 job... plus 24/7 availability via smartphone. And since not everyone's vacations are taken at the same time, you basically have to do a little bit of work to keep things on track since other peoples' work is dependent on your labor.

And then I start to think that basically all I'm doing is generating revenue for one business by working to steal business away from competitors. So much time and resources wasted on something that doesn't even matter.

I'm worried I'm going to burnout and become a ""loser."" Just someone who can't hold down a job because I hate working so much. I feel like the rest of my life is just one big challenge to see if I can survive the rat race. Every day I think I'm going to just stop and not do anything anymore when it gets to be too much.

I apologize for the two month delay after my last post but there have been some very big developments in my employment/living situation and I've been very busy (also I forgot). I was eventually able to find another job for which I had to relocate to another city (not a big deal it's only an hour from where I originally lived).

Anyways onto the good stuff. About two weeks after my previous post, I interviewed for my current job and was offered a position so I had to find a way to quit without drawing any attention to myself. I waited all week until Friday at 3pm, which is when all the pay cheques are sent out, and then I waited another hour and a half before I went to HR to submit my resignation. As I expected the HR person I was directed to speak to about ending my employment was barely functioning (it was 4:30 on a Friday). She barely acknowledged me and just gave me a form to fill out and told me she would enter all the information into the system on Monday morning and then follow up with me. After that I walked out of the building and decided to treat myself to some ice cream before I went home to finish packing up my things for my move the next day. I did receive a call from the HR lady Monday morning and she asked why I was listed as being a part of a defunct department and who my supervisor was. I kinda panicked and told her I didn't know what she was talking about and that all of my information should be in the system before telling her I had to go and hanging up. I guess that worked because I have not received any other calls or emails from that company for the last two months.

This is will probably be my last post about the situation I was in unless something similar happens to me at my new job which I hope doesn't happen. Thanks for reading and commenting on all my posts.

My employee who was working the morning shift texted her, called her and informed me her line had been disconnected. So I tried calling and texting; also disconnected. I emailed her, no response. She has a few longer shifts on Sat/Sun and I'm nervous about it. She hasn't reached out to me at all.

What if something bad happened? How do I approach this? I've had employees skip out but it was usually just because they were being irresponsible, as I said. I just don't want to overstep my boundaries as boss but I'm worried she's hurt or something. What do you think?

Edit: Okay, I called non-emergency and requested a welfare check on her. I hope she's okay and that this is all for nothing. I'll update if anything comes of it.

Edit: I should probably mention she recently broke up with her boyfriend and she told me he was mad about it so that's another factor.

UPDATE: I got home from work. The police haven’t called me back. There’s a staff member at the shop, I told him to stay vigilant. He’s aware of the situation and is just as worried. I looked her up on Facebook and found her profile. It hasn’t been active for months but I still sent a message. Turns out, she lives in a shady part of town. Nothing to report from driving by. It’s like she’s just a ghost. I’m preparing to deal with the possibility that I won’t hear from her again. I have no idea how I’m going to deal with covering her shifts cause I’m on almost 8 days straight of working. Stressed. Some of you have suggested maybe she just skipped town. Seems unlikely but if her boyfriend situation was really bad... who knows? I’m wondering if the police checked on her and it was fine and they just didn’t tell me? Either way, I’m going to reach out to them and try to get an update tomorrow. If she turns up Friday to her shift I’ll be floored and relieved. If she did this just because she “felt like it” I’m going to be disappointed. I doubt it though, she cares.  Thank you for the support guys, I appreciate it. And your kind words. Either way I’m probably going to be hiring.

\---

**FINAL UPDATE:** She got back to me this morning on Facebook and quit over text. She waited until Friday to contact me. Why? Because I called for a Welfare check.  She didn't give me a reason why she skipped work, cut all contact and ghosted me and our staff. But she was mad I sent the cops to do a Welfare check. The police must have done a check and it was fine so they didn't bother calling me back. 

 I woke up to this from her*:* 

*""As a manager you don't send no cops to nobody house you can get me evicted for the fucked up move you just pulled I could've been in jail or out of town somewhere with bad reception I'm taking it personal because you're being unprofessional  now I'll be there to drop off this key y'all did the most ""*

I'm not sure how this is logical, but I guess I don't know her private life. I don't think you can get evicted for a welfare check. Unless she's doing something illegal?  I politely explained that I was worried about her because it was completely out of character for her to be irresponsible. Also, the break up. She was silent for five days. She's was a valuable asset for our store and I'd just given her a raise?  I doubt I'll get a response. I'm a little upset that she doesn't understand why suddenly disappearing would alarm me, the staff. I'm floored. She was with us for three months. Regardless, I hope she does okay out there and I'm happy she is safe and well. At least this didn't end with someone dying, right? I'm disappointed but relieved. I don't think I was unprofessional, just following procedure from email, phone, emergency contact to welfare check. People will notice and care if you're gone. I think it would have been unprofessional if I showed up at her door as her boss. Anyway, thank you for the conversations, support and advise everyone. I appreciate you all.",1533081985.0,2018-07-31 20:06:25

144,My wife put in her two weeks and was offered a 65% pay increase on the spot to keep her,801,c5dv7a,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c5dv7a/my_wife_put_in_her_two_weeks_and_was_offered_a_65/,96,"My wife and I work at a restaurant. She’s the service manager, and lately has been getting really frustrated with the other management, particularly the GM who makes triple her salary while barely working 40 hours a week. She’s gone to him repeatedly over the past 8 months about a raise, originally being promised one at the start of the year. The GM insisted the money wasn’t there and acted like the owner had denied his requests.

As a server who has been working at this restaurant for years and has seen it do far better business under more competent GMs, I feel her frustration, and lately the slow business and the GM’s lazy management style has resulted in most of the front of house staff quitting. 

Anyway, my wife started looking for a new job because with the amount she’s dealing with here she doesn’t get paid nearly enough. She applied to a popular local burger restaurant  and ended up being selected for their service management position over 16 other candidates. She’d have a bit more responsibility than her current position, but they were offering her a 40% - 50% pay increase along with health, vision, and dental. The only downside is the job is hourly instead of salary, but they guaranteed 40 hours and possible overtime. This place is also clearly running way better than the current job, both by looks and their sales.  On the other hand, she really doesn’t want to leave the current job, both because she’s comfortable and she’s put in so much effort into that store and truly does care about it. She just has felt under appreciated and underpaid for being one of the only managers who’s concerned about the store. 

Today, my wife called to put her two weeks in with the current job. The owner found out and offered a 65% pay increase on the spot. Apparently the GM had never even asked him before, and the owner insisted they had to do whatever they could to get my wife to stay. 

Now the decision just got 10000X harder and neither of us can figure out what she should do. A big part of why she wanted to leave was because the pay was so low for the amount she had to deal with and how little she felt she meant to the store. Now she has good offers on both sides and it just feels like we’re stuck in the middle.

Update:

I appreciate all the different responses. A little update since I posted this: in the midst of all of this the owner is finding out for the first time just how bad the GM is. They just sent out anonymous surveys to the staff yesterday asking about the managers individually and he’s already getting torn to shreds. On top of that the GM just left for vacation with a barely staffed store. The owner and my wife just got off the phone and he’s beyond pissed at the GM and offered my wife to fully match the other job’s offer including insurance. 

The staff who had been at the store for a while all knew the owner wouldn’t like the way the GM ran the store if he knew what was going on, but none of us, my wife included, wanted to go above the GMs head to tell the owner in case it backfired. Now that he’s finding it out on his own he’s not happy to say the least. The talks they’re having makes it seems like they’re going to push the GM out, move the current assistant GM (who my wife is friends with and works well with) to his position and move my wife to the AGM position along with the raise and benefits.",1561520049.0,2019-06-25 23:34:09

150,"After 7 months, 120 job applications, and 15 interviews, I finally landed a job offer!",793,cengkb,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cengkb/after_7_months_120_job_applications_and_15/,45,"I have been stalking this subreddit from the moment I graduated school, but I never felt that I was ""qualified"" to give advice seeing that I had not found any success in my career search. While browsing this subreddit, I always found a little bit of motivation in posts where people announced that they received job offers after months or even years of hunting. I figured I would share my story in hopes that it would deliver the same motivation for those still searching.


I graduated from University in December of 2018 with a degree in Marketing. In addition to having a full course load, I was also working full time as an assistant manager at a car wash. In retrospect, I believe that summer internships would have been more beneficial to post-college success, but I needed something stable to pay bills.


Upon graduation, my job search began immediately. I was pretty picky and only applied to jobs that I thought I would enjoy. I stayed far away from sales positions (which are often listed as entry level marketing jobs) as I would almost rather not work than cold call 100 or more people everyday. After almost four months of various screening calls and several in person interviews, I was pretty fed up with the, ""We have decided to move forward with a candidate who more closely aligns what we are looking for in this role...."" emails.


Towards the end of April, I came across a position I knew I was overqualified for on Indeed. It was a part time position with a well known media company and paid surprisingly well for what the role was. It did not necessarily involve marketing, but in order to keep myself sane and finally establish a source of income again, I applied and received an offer! Even after accepting this role, I continued to apply for Marketing positions knowing that the if I were to get comfortable here, it would only become increasingly difficult to find a position in Marketing which I truly enjoy.


After nearly one hundred more job applications and plenty of phone and in person interviews, it was already the end of June. On one of my breaks at my part-time position, I was walking around the campus where I work and came across a directory. Out of curiosity, I decided to check what other businesses were located in the area. One caught my eye. After doing some research, I determined that this company was exactly what I was looking for. Great benefits, casual dress code, unlimited PTO, free snacks, the whole nine. In addition, the business operates in an industry very relevant to my own personal interests. I checked out their careers page and saw only one position posted that was for Marketing. To make matters worse...it was posted ""30+ days ago."" Figuring it was worth a shot, I applied.


Not even a week later, I got my first email stating that they wanted to schedule a phone screening to learn more about me. After knocking that out of the park, I had an additional phone call with the hiring manager, two zoom calls with future coworkers, and went in in person to meet the hiring manager and an additional coworker. Everything went so great I was ecstatic. I was so confident that everything went well, but, I had a lingering nervousness knowing that I have been denied in similar situations like this in the past.


Finally, I received a phone call. I did NOT get the job...

BUT. The hiring manager, and two of the employees I had a chance to talk to, really enjoyed meeting me and felt that I had what it would take to step into the shoes of a role that they had just posted which was also in the field of marketing. After reading the description for this role, I was even more excited than before because this job aligned much more closely with my personal strengths and I knew it was something I would be able to succeed in. In addition, I was informed this new role also had nearly a 35% higher starting pay than the original position I applied for. After one more phone call with the hiring manager discussing the specifics of the role, I had an official offer on the table. I accepted. My first day is August 5th and it still feels like I am living in a dream. 


If I could give one piece of advice to people who are going through the job search grind, I would say to try looking directly at the careers pages of companies located near you. Not every company posts on Indeed. And definitely don't get discouraged by jobs posted over 30 days ago. If I would have not applied after seeing that, I would still be searching. 


Best of luck to everyone and their job search. With enough time and patience, it will all work out. Cheers.",1563451075.0,2019-07-18 07:57:55

As a result I can always see new employees, including those who interviewed for positions I did but didn’t pass. This is just my opinion and is not an indicator of the companies’ hiring reasons.  


Two were straight up internal applicants who were promoted. 


Five people had significantly more experience than myself. On average they had 2-3 years’ experience more than me even though the advert indicated less years. So yes, sometimes people really do have more experience than you.


Three people had the same qualifications than me and experience-wise, we were almost the same. However, two went to waaay more prestigious universities than myself (like top 100 universities). The third person went to the same schools (for both undergrad and postgrad) with one of the senior panelists and I think they knew each other from before.


Three other people had skills that I have but didn’t have certification for. I work in research and have data analysis, proposal writing and literature review skills, all taught during my MSc and data analysis was largely self-taught. However these three went ahead and had certifications from Coursera, IBM and other reputable organizations. 


Two people were younger than myself and also had less experience, though not by a big margin. Maybe they were hired due to other reasons other than qualifications, maybe personality-wise they rocked the interviews. I am a big  introvert and on occasions my demeanor has been brought up in interviews that I don’t look too excited etc. 


I found these insights very interesting. As I said before this are just my observations and can't say for sure this is why they were hired and not myself.

Just wanted to share my job search journey with someone as I’m bustling with excitement and I have no friends.

I quit my old 30k/yr job in Dec ‘17 and moved on NYE to start Masters program. I drove Uber on the side while I powered through classes and certs. In January’19 I passed a major certification (CISSP) and decided it was time to start looking since I would be graduating in May. I immediately got swamped by recruiters, never had to apply for a single role. By the end of February, I was in final talks with three companies A,B,C. Company A made me a lowball offer ($90k), Companies B and C were dragging their feet, company B made me a better ($100k) offer than company A, company C decided they didn’t want to compete so they ghosted me.

I turned down company B’s offer even though it was more, because I liked company A better. Everything was set, until 4 days before the scheduled start date, I got an email saying that they decided to postpone hiring for that role because my boss-to-be was retiring. I had already called off my search at this point, which meant I had to start all over. It really sucked.

3 weeks after scheduled start date, I got another on-site interview with company R which went super well and I was told on the spot that I had the job. The CISO wanted me to work for him so bad. In my car on my way back from that interview, I got a random call from recruiter pitching me another role, (company H) I almost turned her down, thinking I already have a job lined up for sure but I learned my lesson the first time so I entertained it. Fast forward 1 week later I got an on-site interview with company H, while waiting to hear back from Company R, who have now informed me that the CISO’s boss would like to talk to me before I can get on-boarded, (after that discussion, that boss’s boss also wanted to talk and scheduling was a nightmare so this dragged on for weeks)

Long story short, in the time it took for company R to get their shit together, I bagged two offers, one with company H, ($166k plus bonus), who liked me so much they offered me 46k more than I asked, making it $76k more than company A offered. The second random company V who called me back after 2 months from initial contact for an on-site and made an offer 2 days later, ($124k plus bonus) more than company A. So now I had 2 offers and company R finally called back, made an offer ($115k no bonus), right around the range I was expecting, but I had a juicier offer already. All this happened last week - THREE OFFERS! 

I decided to go with company H, mainly (for the money?) because they were the most efficient. From recruiter to Offer took  about 3 weeks, less than any of the other companies took. All in all, 5 offers later, I am starting at my new role this Monday. The most amazing part is company R and V sent me follow up emails saying that if I ever needed a job, to reach out to them first. It all just came together perfectly. And now my starting salary is 500% more than my old salary.

She answers both, and proceeds to talk to both people at the same time. While ignoring me. And talks and talks and talks. It seemed like another 15 minutes. 

She gets off the phone/pager and gives a half-hearted ""sorry"" and cannot even focus on her interviewing sheet. She asks me a poorly worded Q something like, ""How do you think community involvement/action helps the company?"" This is for an entry-level, minimum wage receiving job, which I was hoping to pick up just to fill my boring unemployment time - I'm not new to this game at all. 

I almost lost it completely, but made it clear that I was pretty frustrated and disgusted, quickly went over everything I just wrote in this post and how wrong it was to do to any candidate, and how disrespectful it was of my time. She tried salvaging the interview right there but made some excuse about how short staffed it is today, and I said, ""Well there's NOTHING wrong with rescheduling an interview."" It was clear from her face that never even occurred to her. I said a couple of other things about how unprofessional the whole thing was, then called the recruiter and let him know too. 

\------

I also had an interview yesterday for a higher level position and the hiring manager had just slathered lotion all over her hands, shook my hand which was extremely slimy, and thought that was amusing. She also barely had anything to say and kept saying, ""Soooooo what I can tell you about the company..."" I just practiced asking questions even though the interview was obviously a sinking ship otherwise, since that's where I've always gotten nervous. And then she said, ""Well I want to wrap this up as quickly as possible, I don't want to leave the front desk unmanned!"" There were two receptionists sitting at it. Like, I could see them through the glass window of the conference room. 

\-------

It's absolutely maddening, I've been working for almost two decades, and have had plenty of decent interviews over that time, and cannot recall ever actually being disrespected before in any of them. Some of them have sucked, yes, but not because of outright disregard! But it is a reminder that sometimes a job is open because the long-time employees are horrible people and somebody likely ragequit after months of health-destroying stress.",1570239781.0,2019-10-04 21:43:01
163,I quit my job in the middle of a pandemic because it was affecting my mental health. My story is inside; if you are on the fence about quitting I hope this gives you the confidence to take the leap.,748,j9tchf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/j9tchf/i_quit_my_job_in_the_middle_of_a_pandemic_because/,105,"I am an attorney and I was laid off from a great (albeit slightly low-paying) job back in June due to the pandemic. Panicked because I had never been laid off before, I started firing off resumes to jobs posted on Indeed at light speed. I got a job interview roughly a week after getting the bad news and, just two days later, I was offered the job.

I never quite felt right taking this job. It was technically in my wheelhouse, but in a specific area of law that I never anticipated nor wanted to work in. But hey, it will definitely pay the bills, so why not?

Well, the job was a freaking nightmare. Long days, billable hours, tedious work, constant deadlines, a demanding, hyper-neurotic head partner, opposing counsel whose purpose you'd swear was only to fight you on everything, and lots of other stuff I won't go into here. Some people seem okay with this type of work, but I was *miserable*. I started losing sleep over the job probably in the second week and every bone in my body fought driving there in the morning. I spent far too much of my precious free time complaining about the job and stopped doing things I really enjoyed. The only positive, other than the pay, was that it taught me *a lot* about what I can and cannot take in a job. If you ever get a job that teaches you this lesson, do yourself a favor and *learn from it*.

So I quit; I did what every person will tell you is a bad idea and quit without another job lined up. Worse still, I did it during a global pandemic. Usually, you should wait until you have another job lined up to leave a job. However, one major downside of this is how little time you actually have to search for work while working full time. Fortunately, because I keep an [emergency fund](https://investor.vanguard.com/emergency-fund/), I had several months expenses saved up and basically focused all my free time finding something new. But I was still extremely anxious about what might happen if I didn't find a job before I run out of money.

Well, since leaving the job on September 24, I received three job offers and accepted one this morning. More importantly, I asked during the interview what the hours looked like, my billable requirements, etc., to make sure this job would not be walking into exactly the same situation I just left. Just about everything I hated about the previous job is apparently absent from this one. Plus, I'll be practicing in an area of law I really enjoy.

I start next week and am *so* much happier. I can't imagine what my life would look like if I was still at the previous job, especially as I post this on a Monday morning. 

My advice to the rest of you is to do the same if it at all makes sense. Meaning, if you have any marketable skills at all, and you can make it a few months without an income, and you get physically ill at the thought of going to work in the morning, just leave and spend your newly-found free time looking for something better. Leave and don't look back. You *will* find something. Only if you cannot make it even one or two months on your savings and you are completely new to a career or some other combination of circumstances should you stay at a job that makes you miserable.

As far as the actual job hunting goes, networking is the name of the game. I essentially got this job by just calling people and asking for work. One particularly helpful person I contacted asked several others for me, one of them bit and eventually hired me. I know what I'm saying breaks absolutely no new ground, and I know for many that networking is extremely hard (I feel you on this, I'm bad at it too) but bite the bullet and do it. Ask people for work, ask people for advice, ask people about their job, ask people to grab lunch or coffee. It's almost like a cheat code if you can make yourself do it it works so damn well.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure how to feel about this virus. I didn't lose my job thankfully, but most of my friends and family did. I was working towards a promotion and would have made a year prior to the state of affairs, but now with the grim reality that my job has received funding from the Paycheck Protection Program, I'm almost certain that my promotion is slipping away, as they can barely stay afloat. 

&#x200B;

While I am very grateful that I have a job still, my family does not, so I am the breadwinner in my household at the moment. It's a very scary feeling. I'm on all forms of government assistance, my housing complex provides food to low-income residents, and I'm applying to every form of monetary help I can. It all just seems so grim. 

All of my colleagues are able to find new jobs, with better pay, or higher job titles and all of the work I've done in my job so far seems trivial. All of the individuals with whom I've spoken to in passing, at the laundromat, at the coffee shop, front-desk receptionists, all seem so happy. 

&#x200B;

How can anyone be happy? I feel COVID-19 has ruined my chances at a real future. At a way to move up the corporate ladder. As a way to make a sustainable living. I'm a couple of years out of college, and as a millennial, had to deal with the dot-com bubble, the 2008 financial housing crisis, 9/11, and now this.   


Can I just not get a break? It almost just seems like it's not worth trying anymore. Even individuals on unemployment are receiving more then I am.

Instead of giving my hell of a job two weeks I quit on the spot. They don’t deserve such a notice for how bad and harassing management is and how they treated me and my coworkers. I had anxiety every day at that job always in fear of being fired when I did nothing wrong and always did all my work on time. I was micromanaged to the point of my manager making me keep an excel sheet detailing what I was doing every minute of my day and then her saying during our team meetings that she doesn’t micro manage us. Both her and the owner are control and power freaks that belittle others and feel this compelling need to have their hands controlling every aspect of the business.

I’m finally free and moving on to better things.
The weight has been lifted.
Don’t be afraid to leave a soul sucking, anxiety inducing job. Yes money is important but your health is more important.

Edit: Everyone’s point about the professional 2 week notice is very valid and true! It’s especially true if you want to use the job as a reference or have unpaid time you need to cash out on. 

In my case this was a small company of under 50 that was full of family running the show, more than half a turnover in the year I was there and managers with no management experience so I don’t really plan on using them as reference ever. I had to get out for the sake of my mental health plus I had no unpaid leave at all so it’s not like I had anything I’d lose. Couldn’t stay somewhere that made me break down a few times due to bullying management.

172,Why you should NOT accept underpaid internships as an educated adult,728,j2icem,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/j2icem/why_you_should_not_accept_underpaid_internships/,117,"My general rule of thumb is that if it is underpaid, overworked, and asks for a degree and literally any amount of professional experience, it's not an internship at all. It's a scam. I would rather be a server for another year or two while I wait for an actual job opportunity as opposed to feeding into this kind of disgusting bs.

I bring this up because I'm an illustrator and I recently came across yet another job listing like this today and this is what it said:

""This is a paid internship position -- you can earn *up to $100 per day*... The motion graphics designer hired will have 1 primary role -- and this is where it gets fun. Your job is to create (1) 3-5 minute cartoon every 2 weeks. We will provide you with the characters, voiceovers, and script. It is your job to turn those voiceovers and provided characters into something amazing. As close to a 'TV cartoon show' as possible. Eventually we will scale up to 1 cartoon per week, but I want to start slow at 1 every 2 weeks and figure out the best way to work together.

This is a position for (1) talented motion graphics designer.""

&#x200B;

For real, don't be so desperate to get your foot in the door of your industry that you are willing to accept a *maximum* of $100 for what would likely be 18+ hours of work a day. By taking jobs like that you're not just hurting yourself for a short period of time, you are hurting the entire industry in the long run. Don't let employers think this is acceptable, don't let them profit off your desperation, and for the love of god please don't let them spread this business model any further than it already has.

&#x200B;

Edit: Yes, animation really takes that long. And 18+ hours a day for one person to complete 3-5 minutes of ""TV Cartoon"" quality animation in 2 (and later 1!!) week is actually a very generous estimate on my end. In reality, it would not be possible without lowering the quality standards significantly (which then gives them the leeway to not pay you the full $100 a day, because the finished product doesn't meet their standards and they have the pay worded as ""UP TO $100 a day"")

For anyone curious, jobs like these are illegal and can be reported. Please be cautious and read the wording carefully when searching for jobs. If you get really excited and then all of a sudden see a red flag, no matter how small, it is worth looking into and possibly reporting so that they can't take advantage of anyone else.

I worked as an account manager at an IT consultancy company. We'd been stuck working from home since March, and the weekly one-on-ones with my manager (a great guy) where always through Google Hangouts. Then on 29th June I got a google calendar invite from my manager for a 'one on one' at the office. In a small interview room on the ground floor. I was kind of suspicious about this. I checked the director's and the HR director's calendars, and they had a 'busy' slot at that time. So yeah.

The meeting was scheduled for 30 June. By then I was already sure they'd fire me and I was doing my best to accept it. When I walked in ten minutes early, my manager and the director were already there. Manager got to the point fairly fast, and said they wanted to end my employment there. I'd prepared my reaction and responded professionally that I understood. Director said he was surprised by how coolly I reacted. Talked for ten minutes, then the HR Director came in (the most useless one you can imagine) to take care of the paperwork and that was that. 

I called my wife from the car and explained it. When I got home she had already been looking for job vacancies for me. I've got a bachelor's degree in nursing, and she found an opening at a home health practice for self-employed nurses. Called them, had a drink with the coordinator the next day and signed the paperwork. I did all the adminstrative stuff that week (insurances, registering as self-employed etc) and I started on 7th July, just a week after I was fired.

Afterwards I heard from the front desk secretary at my old company that the nursing coordinator had called them for a reference check and had asked for HR. Since the secretary knew of my relationship with the HR Director, she forwarded the call to my manager instead, who gave me a glowing reference. 

My last salary as an employee was 1700 euro (after taxes) for the month of June.

My first salary as my own boss was 2500 euro for 14 days of work.

175,Five things I did to instantly raise my interview rate by 6x,724,8k6oj5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8k6oj5/five_things_i_did_to_instantly_raise_my_interview/,64,"So, I had a decent sample size of applications (200+) where my interview rate was only about 3 percent (i.e., I got six interviews in 200 applications). I made a few changes to my approach, and my response rate has gone up about 6x (I received 18 interviews for about 100 applications). These are all no connection to the org, no referral situations:

**1) Add a keyword section to your resume**. I added a keyword section to the bottom of my resume (titled ""Relevant Skills""). This is about four lines long, and will include the relevant  key words from all of my applications. I theorize that at least in my field, recruiters and resume reading software looks for certain keywords or your resume is out. 

**2) Optimize your keyword/skills section on LinkedIn and generalize your job descriptions**. You basically get 50 skills to list on LinkedIn. I've discovered that when you apply for a job, your profile is shared with the recruiter, and manytimes they don't look at your nice tailored resume, they look at your profile. They also can see how much of a ""fit"" you are with a position based upon Linkedin-generated algorithm of the skills and profile info you've entered. I simply grabbed the keyword skills section from like 50 resumes, did a word cloud count, and then added these 50 skills to my profile. This put me in the top 10% of fit of nearly every job I applied to overall. 

Also, I made my actual work responsibility job descriptions super general, broad, and vague at each position, so a recruiter can't eliminate me for siloing me as a subject matter expert in one area. I actually had TWO recruiters mention that they only looked at my profile, and I should resubmit my resume to them. Also, this is important even if you apply through Indeed instead of LinkedIn, because I have had several recruiters from jobs I applied through on Indeed use LinkedIn profile to qualify me.

**3) Apply as soon as the job is posted is most important**. I try to apply within 24 hours to all posted positions. I'd estimate that 3-5% are removed within 48 hours because they got enough applicants. I also have a hunch that lazy recruiters scan the first 50 or so and then interview ""good enough"" candidates for many positions. I believe this because I tend to be less qualified for positions where I get a quick call back (e.g., a couple days after the position has been posted).

**4) Look at all of the job posting sites for postings**. Some jobs are posted on Indeed, or SimplyHired, or LinkedIn way later than they are on the other sites. I've noticed that many jobs are posted first on Indeed (not sure why), but will then post to LinkedIn like 3 or 4 days later. At this point if you applied through LinkedIn, you are likely DOA. 

**5) Realize it is a numbers game and don't be scared to apply to jobs that you feel you are not quite qualified for yet.** I have been getting responses for jobs that I previously thought were out of my league. It is really hard to tell if the job requirements are idealized/only require basic exposure, or are seeking for depth. So, I have a quickly tailorable resume method for these apps and try to basically grind out an application as fast as possible with accurate relevant key words. About a third of my responses were for jobs that I thought I was not qualified for yet (e.g., needing 12 years of experience, but I have 8).

**Bonus**. I do not use cover letters unless 1) I am a perfect 100% fit for the application requirements in some unique way, or 2) I am applying to a smaller company where they may actually read my cover letter. After I do get an interview, I have asked to provide a supplementary cover letter though. This has made my applications much more efficient, and 80% of my interviews have come from positions without cover letters.",1526611614.0,2018-05-17 22:46:54

*I quit* my first job after six months of being there, it was a call center job that paid a lot of money (in theory, if they didnt keep cutting our hours and skirting labor laws) back in April 2018.

I have been unployed from that day until this morning. That's 16 months of no income aside from being a freelance writer and hleping our family business (which didnt pay me).

I quit because I saw my boss, who has been working in that company for eleven years get demoted from being a supervisor to an entry level agent like me when the biggest client bailed on the company. But he couldnt really do anything but take it.

He was trapped in there, in that volatile career, because call center is such an unmarketable experience in any other field beside other call centers, and because hes gotten used to the money, no matter how unstable his future might be. 

He's in his thirties with no degree and the sole provider of his family. He told me to that I should leave while I still could.

So I did.

It was in the middle of a storm and I remember how free I felt that day, no more mental drainage, no more making other people's problem *my* problem. 

But it didnt last. As soon as my savings were drained, I was toast because my parents were very unhappy to support me again just as I was unhappy to need it. Taking their begrudged money that always came with demands and side criticisms ate away at my self respect.

I immedietely applied for every entry level openings I could find in four or five different apps. I went back to my university and asked the help of their placement team twice. I asked all my college, high school and church friends if they knew any job openings. I walked all over the city and in my home town and looked for signs of hiring. 

It was an exhausting, humiliating, heartbreaking and unending task that yielded me a daily stream of rejection emails.

 I mustve applied for around 400+ jobs in the span of a year and despite my degree and job experience (in call center! See? It's really useless) I had fewer than 30 call backs. But no job.

There would be weeks where I would just stop applying because I was **exhausted**, looking for a job is a full time job of its own. And frankly I couldnt bring myself to wake up early again and wait for a couple of hours in my business attire just so someone can ask me questions that they can read on my resume and online profile only for them to never call back.

And everyone I know who knows I am job hunting only asks me one thing whenever they see me: hows the job hunting? Have you found one? Did those people call you back?

I tried every advice for interviews—be professional, be friendly, be brief, be passionate, know all the answers, smile, put on make up, don't put on make up. .

I even applied for minimum wage, unskilled jobs and still didnt get the positions. Everyone is advicing me to sink myself lower and lower just to increase my chances. 

There came a point where my mom would send me every job opening she sees.

 She thought that I couldnt afford to have standards because I am just an unemployed person, and she even told me so, ""I don't care if you dont feel comfortable in that place, you have to take that job,"" when I got hired to be a glorified servant that made below minimum wage with no benefits. 

That's it, if youre unemployed you don't deserve the courtesy of being comfortable, of having your time respected, of being treated like a professional, and choosing is practically a luxury to you, you unemployed nameless applicant. Because you also dont deserve a name other than candidate or applicant.

But finally, I just said, screw this. I am worth more than these labor work and shady companies and looked for a job that suited me.

Imagine that, looking for a job that suited **your** preference and needs instead of pleading for companies to give you any work.

I stuck it out, and when the interview came for that perfect job, I told them that they needed me. And honestly, because I looked for a job that suited me perfectly, it was true, they do need me, a perfect candidate for their job.

Well, Reddit, today I got that job and I start tonight. I will be part of a marketing firm that creates campaigns for businesses. I am gonna make more than I ever did and in line to make even more.

Even if this job doesnt pan out to be my forever home, that's okay. I have developed the skills of looking for the perfect job for me and I know I can replicate it over and over again.",1567697004.0,2019-09-05 11:23:24
178,"My go-to question for interviewers usually makes them compliment me, inception-style",713,ccwuz7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ccwuz7/my_goto_question_for_interviewers_usually_makes/,77,"""What are some characteristics of a high performer for this job?""

&#x200B;

The interviewer will regurgitate things from the job description like ""can deal with ambiguity"" and ""team-worker"". If you've done your homework and have already highlighted your aptitude towards those during the interview (as you should), 90% of the time the interviewer **will reference your experience** as they're listing the characteristics.

&#x200B;

It feels like inception, having them make the connection out loud themselves. It reinforces it in their mind.

&#x200B;

Another one of my personal favorites, if you liked that one, is ""is there anything else from my resume or from what you've heard that you have thoughts or concerns about?"" 50% of the time, the interviewer will open up and mention something that may not have occurred to you, and gives you a chance to address it directly.

Edit: Controversial among comments, use sparingly and only if you can read the room well. Still personally one of my favorites

&#x200B;

Note: I've interviewed *a lot,* I'm weirdly good at it. I was motivated to post when reading a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bssa3a/when_the_interviewer_asks_if_you_have_any/) with a similar question. The quote in the post is a good one, but achieves a different result. In my opinion: ""qualities"" is less human than ""characteristics"", and asking about people that don't succeed puts the recruiter in a negative mindset. It's the same reason why you don't say ""while I don't have X"", instead, you say ""I have Y""",1563094143.0,2019-07-14 04:49:03

Went from doing Corps work (americorps & peace corps - 19k in THREE years to making 50k). Still in government.)

**Resume format:** 1 page. I followed the advice from r/resumes of writing ""Selected Experience"". I think this allowed recruiters & hiring managers to assume that I had more experience, but I CHOSE what to share with them.  I brought copies of my two page resume (edited the bullets to fit whatever job it was for) to the actual interview, along with supplemental materials. Do this in a way that shows your aptitude but doesn't give away your work ;)

`NOTE - I did not usually submit my 2pager. I BROUGHT IT WITH ME to the interview and said, ""here's my full work/volunteer history for future reference."" This provides them with the opportunity to look it over and have more of an idea of what I've done.`

I also gained traction when I used my bulleted cover letter.

**During the job search:**

* Create an excel sheet of the jobs you've applied to & contact information. Following up got me 6 interviews. I believe it helps to make sure a person sees your resume/application. I followed up with a brief email (1-2 weeks after applying) and attached my resume and cover letter (addressed to the person I followed-up with)!  Not everyone will reply, but some will :)
* Always follow up in the morning. Dont' get lost in their inbox (6 am - 11 am)
* Apply to the most interesting positions in the morning (if you can) / when you're not all checked out. Save the ""moderately/least interested"" jobs for later.

**Job interview prep: I found myself getting so worked up about knowing a good amount of the company that I'd lose focus on being myself and natural. I interviewed best (& received other offers) when I didn't focus too much** ***on them***\*\*. I also noticed that trying to have planned responses would choke me up because I'd be so focused on trying to fit them into the interview even when they didn't really answer their questions.\*\* ***Take a moment to pause and think about their questions!! REMEMBER, you already have the answers!!!***

*Print out the job description & write where you performed that task next to each bullet. This helped me visualize that I can do the job and have experience in whatever it is.*

**During the job interview:**

* A confident handshake (more important than you think), **good posture**, dress as best as you, arrive 30-40 min early (I spent about 15-20 min in my car - reviewing notes/observing people) this helped me realize - **everyone is just a person**.
* Ask questions during the interview and this allowed it to seem more like a conversation. Don't be afraid to chime in. Strategically.
* ASK FOR BUSINESS CARDS. This makes it easier to send thank you emails. As soon as you get to your car, write one thing down about each person on the back of their card.
* I have a nice leather folder that I put resumes in. Even if I didn't hand them a copy of my resume, I feel like it can add a nice touch.

**Common job interview questions included:**

* tell me about yourself (80/90% professional / 20,10% personal) - I think having a great  answer to this sets the tone and interest levels.
* what would you bring to this role/why you/what do you know about this company?
* weakness or something you should work on? Avoid the ""I'm too hard on myself"" BS answers
* what would you do during your first few months?
* where do you see yourself in x years/what are your career  goals?

Some of you may object to this. BUT if you have time, I say apply to positions you're pretty sure you can receive an interview for. The practice helps. Practice. I had a few fillers and I got better and better at interviews as time went on.

**Do you have any questions/end of interview:** Remember, you're interviewing them too. I think this shows your confidence and self-worth. Ask thoughtful questions. Ask questions that aren't so overused. They're probably interviewing a handful of people and this is your chance to shine. Don't bore them. Ask thoughtful questions that show your genuine interest in the position.

**Post-interview:** send a thank you note. concise & personable.

**The ""SECOND"" INTERVIEW/waiting game:** I grew frustrated with having weird waiting gaps in between and feeling like I could miss out on an opportunity if I took another one too quickly (while waiting to hear back). I scheduled my second interviews around the same week as one another.

**INDEED:** didn't apply much through there. I checked the org website itself and applied through it. I only applied using indeed for stuff i felt ""meh"" about. Apply through the org website. Especially if the position really interests you.

**RANDOM TIPS:**

* **Proof read your resume, make sure your dates are aligned, and no awkward white spaces**
* have a generic cover letter to just attach. No sense on wasting time if the position doesn't jump out @ you. But at least have something to attach. This sometimes gets you beyond the HR person. I've heard they'll sometimes automatically toss an application without a cover letter.
* Always have a pen.
* Brush your tongue (hate to be the one laughing with white stuff all over your tongue). When waiting, try to use the nearest bathroom. This will eliminate the chances of you having to go during the interview. Look in the mirror, superhero stance, and tell yourself  ""I got this!""
* SET JOB ALERTS. I applied as soon as one opened and they interviewed me while it was STILL POSTED. APPLY EARLY (imo, 15-20 days or less from the initial posting.)
* If you're unemployed - look for PT or volunteer work while you job search.
* Make sure your resume is quantified and states your accomplishments vs responsibilities - very important.
* If offered a position and you're waiting to hear back from another one. Try to ask them if you can be sent an explanation of potential benefits and have 3-5 days to think things over. This will buy yourself time. In the meantime, follow-up with other positions.
* Go with your gut when turning down positions. It came down to a 34k vs 50k job. The 50k job doesn't have a ""warm NGO vibe"", but I've done the ""warm NGO vibe"" for too long and need $.
* Pros and cons list of jobs. Commute, pay, benefits, people, work atmosphere.
* Keep up with current events (outside of the company) but within your industry. It'll make you feel as if you know what's going on!
* Exercise (if you can). Read. Pick up a hobby. When you tell them about yourself you wanna come off as passionate about what you do in your free time.
* Mix up your job boards. Staring at Indeed too long gets lame.
* Follow up 1-2 weeks after submission: I lurk the company's website. If I don't see HR, I take a guess and send  it to someone in the dept./area that I'm applying to. Some people are  kind enough to tell me they'll forward my materials and some of the emails went unanswered; whatever. **TIP: send it someone who isn't too high up to ignore it and  not too low that they're ignored, LOL**
* For jobs you REALLY care about, copy and paste / save it to your computer. Nothing worse than getting a call and not having the damn description.

I have always been an A student through high school and college, and I was able to get a few paid internships because of it but my experience in the real world just hasn’t been as smooth as I expected. In school I worked independently and banged out assignments one after the other. I felt stress but it was mostly manageable. I find work in an office setting a little bit too stressful. There’s more emphasis on team work and sometimes it means working with people I don’t particularly enjoy. I’m less independent and if I screw up, it undermines everyone else’s work. I’ll admit, my work ethic hasn’t always been the best but I just do whatever is asked of me.

I know I can’t avoid the real world forever and I need to start making money eventually, but I’m having a tough time with transition from the books to work. What can I do to ease my transition into it?

203,Leaving the most toxic company I've worked for after 6 months+ worth of non-stop job search,685,d38g8b,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d38g8b/leaving_the_most_toxic_company_ive_worked_for/,45,"r/jobs has been a source of motivation for me. And this is my way to giveback to the community, now that I have successfully escaped my role in a failing startup company.

This is my story: a young university graduate who was working at the most toxic startup company — manipulative, micromanage, outright LIE to employees and customers about our products and company growth, frequent firings just because they did not agree with the management's decisions. 

I managed to stay in the company for 1 year + because of two reasons:

1. I simply cannot afford to quit without a job. I need to pay student loans, rent, etc. No savings whatsoever because of the low pay. You see, it's simply a viscious cycle.
2. I keep failing my interviews. Yes, this is another big factor. My CV has gotten me at least 10+ interviews throughout the 6 months of job searching. And those 10+ interviews are with big, big corporates and pre-screened (phone, online assessments), and I managed to bomb them during the face-to-face interviews. And anyone who has a job and looking for a job knows how DIFFICULT it is just to make time for the interviews. Schedule them before/after work. Go during lunchtime. Fake sick leave. Use annual leave. The process is simply exhausting and you can only use the same excuse for so many times before looking suspicious. 

I have been searching since Feb 2019 and I can tell you that, I have been putting 90% of my time from Feb - Aug 2019 in job searching. That includes after work hours, weekends. I sarificed my sleeping time, socializing time to refine my CV, study online assessment tests, interview tips, preparing for interviews... And by the mark of early August, I've got nothing. Absolutely NOTHING. I was so stressed and depressed at the time because

1. I have been doing well academically all my life, excelling in internships, doing community work, only to get myself stuck in a terrible company that is badly managed. I just feel my 20s is WASTED and my life is OVER because of my career situation. It definitely does not help that I am am ambitious person and my peers have already climbing up the corporate ladders all these while.
2. I feel worthless after getting all these rejection emails. They're 100% demoralizing, especially rejections after face-to-face interviews. It's almost like being rejected just because they've seen me in person and HATE me enough that they do not want to see me ever again. 

Yeap, that was the mental state of mine at the time. Everything was so dark and I simply cannot see the end of the tunnel. The job sucks to its core and I have bills to pay and I was just so tired trying to survive.

And this situation changed completely in the month of August. I was invited to a first-round interview in one of the biggest players in the industry that I was super interested in. Heck, I was hesitated to apply for that role in the first place because I was intimidated by the job descriptions and requirements but I applied anyway at the time. Thinking to myself that I have nothing to lose, I started preparing for the interview. Company profile, industry news and trends, the implications, how can my profile fit into the role, and questions that I'd like to know more. The first-round interview went exceptionally well. It really felt like the manager and I really think alike and synced very well. I quickly followed up with a thank you email and he replied to me, saying that ""I was very impressed by the effort and passion you exhibited during the interview"". I was invited for a second-round interview after 2 weeks, long story short, I've gotten the job that I could've never in my life dreamt of and I am starting the job very soon with a work trip to Europe scheduled. 

So moral of the story? Never give up. AND TRUST ME I know this is an ""easier said than done"" kind of thing because I totally get that. You just CANNOT see the end of it while you ARE IN IT. It's totally understandable and I've been there. But keep in mind, you only have the chance to get out IF you do not give up. Do not give up and try to see how your current actions can be improved, by asking friends for opinions etc. 

I truly hope my story can at least give one person here a reason not to give up and have faith in oneself to have the kind of career that you truly deserve.",1568326195.0,2019-09-12 18:09:55

208,A good manager will make or break a workplace,666,i9t4kg,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/i9t4kg/a_good_manager_will_make_or_break_a_workplace/,63,"I just wanted to tell a bit of my story. 

I used to work in a private hospital, as a nurse in the operating theatres. There were a lot of problems in our department most relating to management, communication, education, and then the nurses cliques and general bitchiness. 

The top manager for the whole department must have decided early on that I wasn’t one of her favourites. I did my best every day and loved the work that I did, but I wanted to learn as much as I could. Somewhere along the way, my eagerness to learn and my pushing to be better became something of a threat or an insult to those above me, and I never really understood why. But this became the source of all my problems. 

I would ask to learn new procedures or skills, only to be told ‘no’. There was always some ‘reason’ but the justifications never made sense to me when others at my same level/qualification or even those with less training/experience/qualifications would be given the opportunities I had been seeking. This led to so much resentment and anger in the department and made the workplace a living hell for me. I still loved my work, but I hated my workplace. 

I ended up leaving quite suddenly and started working in a different field altogether. I am still a very eager worker and I want to be the best I can be at everything I do, but I tried to rein in my enthusiasm and spend at least a bit of time towing the line and trying not to rub anybody the wrong way. 

My manager at my current job has a long history of dealing with shitty managers and supervisors and colleagues, and you can see from very early on she’s a leader for her team, not just a manager. She collaborates with each member of the team, asks our opinions as we are the experts in our respective fields, and goes out of her way to resolve conflicts amicably and address any negative emotions floating around to make sure every team member is happy and able to work together harmoniously. 

We had to have a ‘talk’ (one of those serious boss to employee talks) recently about a minor situation that unfolded recently which resulted in me becoming quite flustered and anxious. She spoke with me for almost an hour, used stories from her own experience, and used the additional training she’d been doing outside of work in conflict resolution to help me to identify what happened that led to me feeling the way I did. She also helped me to figure out better ways to handle certain situations, all with the overall goal of maintaining a harmonious workplace. 

I’ve gone from feeling anxious, angry, confused, stressed, insignificant, useless, worthless, and completely invalid, to feeling empowered, strong, independent, safe, confident, but more importantly, happy. Anyone can be a manager, but only a true leader will ensure that each and every employee is able to come to work bringing their a-game, and makes work a place that you really enjoy. I’m so glad I made the decision to leave a toxic environment and I hope this can help even one person make the decision to move on and search for something better, because no job is worth your happiness and mental health.",1597464087.0,2020-08-15 00:01:27
209,Looking Back,667,hxdsll,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hxdsll/looking_back/,76,"I am a lot older than most regular users of Reddit. I have read the post of the post graduates just entering the job market and I feel for you. There is an anguish that comes from changing gears and moving from college life to the adult work-a-day grind. There is a desire to obsess about your first job choice. You ask yourself ""how does this fit with my career goals? Is this a dead end? What if I can't do this forever?"" I get it,

Allow me to give you a broad view looking in my own rear view mirror. 

First, do not panic. The job you are doing now will not be your life's work. With the way technology is moving it probably won't exist in five years. My career path has been a game of Frogger (If you don't know Google it) where I jumped from one opportunity to the next. I lost the game a time or two but I always manged to find employment opportunities even if they weren't the ones I wanted.

Careers are more about hind sight. You tend to see a pattern in your career over time that you cannot see looking into the future. The more jobs you have and the more skills you gain the more you can direct the flow of your career but you will never be in full control. Economic down turns happen. Whole industries crash and burn (I spent 12 years in check processing.) Skill sets go obsolete. This is not your fault but it is a part of keeping your eye out for the next rock to jump to in crossing the stream.

I cannot stress enough the importance of friends. I have kept in touch with my workplace friends over the years. We have a life bond. We spent a good deal of our lives together. They are also a good source for that next move. Every friend you have knows three other people. A referral is the best form of job lead and I have been on the receiving end of a few in my time.

Please have some savings. Put something away out of every paycheck even if it's just $20 because the rains will come and even if they don't you may want to move to a new city to take a job. You may want to get an apartment closer to you job. The list is endless but having money equals having opportunity and options. If you are just starting out do not put this off.

There will be times in your professional life that you will be shattered. The company you love just folded. You go from being super busy to being on the street. It is very very hard not to take it personally but don't. It is a lonely time. You will feel that you have no place and it's tough to face the world. It is these times that you need solid friends and relationships to see you through. Like money, be sure to cultivate real friendships outside of work.  You are not who you are because of the job you have.

Sometimes the job you hate will turn into the job you love with just a personal change. Sometimes you will make a friend for life or get a work partner that is very special to you. Sometimes, if you are lucky, you will love that person like a brother or a sister. Life is funny, short, tragic and beautiful all rolled into one. You will see more of how your life turned out when you reach my age and look back on it. Best of luck to all of you.",1595667595.0,2020-07-25 04:59:55

I sit at the front desk, and do a lot of different duties, but mostly administrative work. Of course I am responsible for the place looking tidy, ensuring there is enough coffee and supplies etc but this makes up only a fraction of my work. Most of it is spent booking travel arrangements for execs, booking spaces, fulfilling orders etc.

We would have many clients come in daily to our office so it was not just the staff to impress, but we closed due to everything right now. I called up and cancelled our janitorial services temporarily (which used to come in every day) since no one would be in the office anyway. Now we are starting to open back up in phases with the first 10-15 staff or so now coming to the office permanently.

I went in to the office yesterday to prepare something for opening and the place stunk. It was dusty, smelly etc. It's not from rotten food but just a general stiff no air flow environment for the past 3 months.

I expressed to my boss we should get the janitorial service back in before we open (or very soon again after we reopen) because of this and he expressed that they will not be starting this back up because of how few people are going to be there and it is too expensive for now. It will now be my responsibility to vacuum, take out garbage, mop, dust. Etc.

I fully understood that I could be responsible for some extra sanitizing practices like sanitizing door handles etc. But this is ridiculous. I am not a janitor. I did not sign up to mop floors. A co worker (who works at a different location but same company) also expressed they were unhappy and the boss said something like ""well you guys are cheaper than hiring the cleaning service"".

I just went through a month long interview process, 3 phone interviews, two in person interviews, not once did we discuss actual salary numbers. I must have led on roughly how much I was making, and the closest we ever got to a salary discussion was them saying ""we'd most likely be offering you what you are currently making.""

I received a phone call last night saying I'll be getting an offer letter tomorrow, they told me the amount it would be (which was essentially a little less than I currently make, but very close). I said I would need to think it over and do some math based on insurance costs and other benefits.

Today I got the offer, after doing some math, and realizing it would be cheaper to stay on my wife's insurance, I countered for 5% more saying that I feel that is fair, based on the premiums they would be saving, since I would not be utilizing their benefits package.

Less than an hour later I received this email.

*""I fully respect your position and believe that you have the best intentions.  However, due to the prior discussions that we had regarding the salary and benefits position of [Company], I believe it to be in the best interest of [Company] to rescind the offer effective immediately. It is not that we do not negotiate salary in good faith.  We do negotiate and we fully respect that our employees will  expect increases to their current salary.  On the other hand, I know that the other candidate is equally (or perhaps more) eager to work at [Company] and at this point, I feel more comfortable going with the other candidate.""*

I spoke with the woman I have been dealing with the better part of a month and she told me that there is nothing that can be done, since management was split on which candidate to hire. 

The woman I was speaking to has basically told me over and over that I would be getting the offer, I was far more qualified than any other candidates, and she just needed the approval of the other managers and the president.

I have never heard of an offer being rescinded, just some companies stating that they are going to stand firm on their original offer. I guess... maybe it is not correct to negotiate a job offer.

Time for a drink...

**EDIT:** Big thanks for all the comments, based on a few friends giving me their input and all the comments, I realize that I am probably still better off. I am pretty sure I would have enjoyed the day to day a little more from this ex-potential job, I think the job I have now will be better in the long run.",1563943075.0,2019-07-24 00:37:55

It was so painful to watch: all I knew my granddad as was him sitting in his armchair and reading the papers. All.day.long!

Since we didn’t live in the same country, I only got to see my grandparents a couple times a year, especially on Christmas, Easter and during the summer holidays.

So, it’s not like he got to see my sister and me on a weekly basis.

But he showed very little interest in doing anything at all.

Not playing with us.

Not helping grandma with something in the house (she literally did everything from cooking, to picking up the phone to taking care of the garden).

Nothing at all. 

All he did was sitting there, being grumpy and miserable.

It really looked a bit as if he was just waiting to die.

And trust me, he was fit right until a few months before he passed away. He absolutely could have gone on new ventures and enjoy his sunset years.

But somehow, he had his light already turned off. 

My granddad got retired when I was about 2 years old. So, I only knew him post-career and all throughout my childhood I thought that’s just who he is.

Until my mum and my grandma told me one day that he used to thrive in his job. He was a master brewer and even got to travel to China to meet some clients a few times. 

Everything that had to do with his career lit him up. It was literally his whole life. His whole self!

And so when he got retired, that all fell away.

I can imagine that part of him died when he had to leave his job behind. And he just didn’t have any plan what to do with himself afterwards. 

Growing up and seeing him like that made me realize very early on that this was something I wanted to avoid at all cost.

And even though I’ve put a lot of effort and work into my education, I’ve never identified myself with it to the extent that I couldn’t think of anything else to do.

**So, here’s my wish to you: please, please, please don’t make your job your whole life!** 

Because if all you do is work for your retirement years, there’s a great chance you’ll end up like my granddad and you’ll struggle to find yourself a new identity!

Make your life enjoyable, get yourself some hobbies, follow your passions and enjoy family time so that your job can complement your personality and not the other way around! 

And through that process you might even discover that your job doesn’t fit your passions and values anymore.

Feel free to share your frustrations here too,645,jg2las,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jg2las/had_an_uncomfortable_interview_this_week_with_a/,190,"It was a final-stage interview. Dude was late, which I was totally fine with given that he had a tight schedule.

The interview started off very weirdly. I could tell that he seemed irritated and uninterested. I got flashbacks from the interview with my ex-company, which I had left due to the insane hours and mismanagement. I had a similar interviewer with a nasty attitude, tells you a lot about the culture.

Anyway, back to this guy. He needed to know all my schooling history, from elementary up to university. I even had to explain why my grades had fallen. (I admit, I should have considered withdrawing from the interview at this point)

But I foolishly continued entertaining the dude. He even got as far as to push me to explain specifically what ""health issue"" I had encountered. The interviewers I came across usually tip-toe around this question as they understood that medical history is one's privacy. Yeah, I suffered from depression.

I understand if he thinks that my personality would not fit the team and the ""fast-paced work environment"", but at least send the message across with some manners.

Idk. At one point I started to understand that this interviewer in front of me hated his life. He complained about the work-life but always wrapped up his mini vent sessions with an optimistic note. People with a horrible work life usually try to justify those hours by thinking they are doing it for growth and a greater good. Everyone has their own beliefs, and I admire the resilience of those who can survive overtime. But I also know that it is not for me.

Well, looks like I have to go back to the job search. Tbh I am burning out a little from months of applications, assessments, interviews and rejections. I went through one screening and another 1-hour case study to reach this final stage and I got treated like crap.

In the end, the interviewer apologized for being late. Totally missed the point. I don't care that you were running late or something. Please, treat other human beings decently. It will affect your company's image.

Sorry, just needed to vent.

Edit: I did not expect the number of responses... and thanks for the awards T\^T I can't reply to every comment but I read them all. For the jobseekers, let's hang in there, a better opportunity will come by. (Sometimes I think I still have to improve my mental resilience. I usually try to understand that maybe the interviewer just had a bad day (like my ex-boss), but interrogating about health and irrelevant grades were simply a no-no.)

I hope this helps others during their job search. 

I graduated in May with a BA in Computer Science. A lot of my college career was thinking I wasn’t cut out for programming at all. I scraped by classes with the help of friends and only until my senior year did I realize I need to step up my game. I took a programming course assistant job at my school so I could relearn all the basics and a bit more advanced programming while helping beginners learn programming. This also made up a bit for not having an internship on my resume. 

After graduating I knew I would have a difficult time but with covid, I really didn’t know what I got myself into. All my friends had jobs lined up with big companies. The first 100 jobs I applied to felt fine. But as I pushed more, I could only think of all the things I was doing wrong. And I questioned my major. I tried studying and applying to so many different things like front end, Ux/Ui, marketing, analyst because I had some freelance experience with all of them. But I got overwhelmed and I ended up giving myself anxiety. In the last few weeks i couldn’t eat or sleep properly. I even hurt my relationship. 

I spent about a week to two weeks focusing on my health and just talking to my friends and family. It helped so much and I realized I should just focus my attention on one field and get back to busting through job apps for that field. I had my resume changed up a lot, I started doing more mock interviews, networking more etc. 

Well it finally paid off. My bf’s friend helped me land a software engineering job and I started crying. I gave up doing my hobby and enjoying games throughout the whole process to find a job. But I’m so happy I can get back into it. 

This sub helped me a lot because of all the similar posts and experiences. I just want to let those who are still searching know that it’s possible! I learned that a lot of the process is to be willing to change and adapt. My bf offered me this advice. If your current process isn’t working, then try a new approach. If you’re feeling down, don’t be afraid to ask others for help. Be willing to take criticism and move on when it doesn’t work out. Keep at it though.

224,My 16-month job search has come to an end,643,f5djl2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f5djl2/my_16month_job_search_has_come_to_an_end/,123,"It’s been an incredibly challenging road, but I’m happy to say that I finally found the right fit. Everyone’s journey is unique but I would say I was pickier than the average job-seeker and not sending out as many applications as I could, due to a few factors I won’t get into. I’m really honored to share what I’ve learned with you all.

**Not-so-impressive Stats:**
16 months of job searching
~ 50 tailored resumes
Dozens more applications with a one-size-fits-all resume
3 full-time offers (two were only a few months into my search, but weren’t a good fit for a few reasons)
1 accepted

**Biggest Mistakes:**

- Bad cover letters: At the beginning of my job search, my cover letters were way too long and just a regurgitation of my resume. Stick to two qualities you want to highlight using details that aren’t in your resume. In the salutation, address the hiring manager if possible, or even the Chief People Officer if you can’t find that info.
- Being underwhelming in phone screens. For a while, I thought my qualifications spoke for themselves and I just had to be polite to get past the phone screen. It wasn’t until a fellow Redditor told me that your elevator pitch sets the tone for the conversation. And it did!

**Biggest surprise:**
A couple months into my search I hired a career coach who opened my eyes to Applicant Tracking Systems. She helped me reformat my resume, deleting invisible tables, then adding summaries, quantitative results and a second page. I fed my resume into an ATS software multiple times before submitting it to a job. Ironically, this format led to zero in-person interviews and zero job offers, even after I tried to condense it to one page. Eventually, I met up with a recruiter who has worked for a few billion-dollar companies. She helped me shred my resume to the point where it didn’t even have enough words to register in the ATS software program. I actually felt MORE confident about my qualifications when my resume had about a third of the word count than my ATS-optimized versions. I received an offer from the first place I used this new resume. (It wasn’t magic—the role also happened to be a great fit.)

**Here’s what I would pass on to the other job-seeking Redditors:**

- If you don’t already know: write a cover letter (under 300 words) whenever there’s an option to; always send a thank-you email within 24 hours of an interview/phone screen; be gracious, even in the face of rejection; always ask thoughtful questions
- Act as though your job search will last for a year. I saved all of my notes from interviews and tried to recall the questions I was asked for future reference. All of my resumes, job descriptions, and cover letters are in Google Docs in a folder I hope I don’t have to look at again for a long, long time.
- Practice with a buddy and/or record yourself. Recording my elevator pitch helped me work on my cadence, duration, and to sound more natural. In a practice interview with a friend, she told me I rocked when I spoke when I thought I was leaning for emphasis. Yikes!
- Compensation: If asked, respond, “It’s too early for me to say, but I’m curious what is budgeted for the role.” That worked every time 100% of the time. When you get the offer, ask if the number they offer is flexible, then (without countering) ask for a day or two to consider the whole compensation package. Other things you can negotiate to get to your value: vacation, flex time, commuter benefits, job title, plan for rapid advancement, employee development.

**My interview and phone screen prep:**

- Research the company. If you’re proud of your LinkedIn profile, creep on your interviewer on LinkedIn. They might creep you back and like what they see.
- Highlight the areas of the job description you are uniquely qualified for and write down how.
- Outline your elevator pitch as it pertains to this role.
- Write down your three strengths and weaknesses (including how you’re working to overcome them). I never got asked these outright, but it was good to prime myself with this info.
- Google some common behavioral questions for the role/department.
- Know why you want THIS job: tie your strengths to what you want to be doing in your career, and how it matches the role or the company.

To all you job-seekers, you WILL find the right fit. And while you’re not actively scrolling or applying, try to relax and enjoy your open schedule. It really helped my stress levels when I realized that even if the job I had applied to that day was “the one,” it would be weeks or months before I would have started. This realization stemmed the persistent voice in my head telling me how badly I needed a job. 

I hope this is helpful to at least some people. Good luck out there!

This is in contrast to some of my colleagues and a former boss who would constantly play up the “advancement and achievement” angle, whereas I basically want to move along steadily, and not get sucked into some shitty LinkedIn hustler attitude that is totally alien to the way I would like to relate to society.

* Work cultures evolving into an expectation that work is something you're passionate about and fulfilling, almost like a religion
* Unreasonable targets and expectations for timelines and project scope based on a constantly smaller set of resources
* Roles are larger and more ambiguous in terms of responsibility, to the point where basically everything is everyone's responsibility
* Division of labor is rarely divided anymore - if you're in IT, you're expected to be extremely business-savvy to the point where stakeholders expect domain proficiency after a couple months of time versus the person they worked with for \~30+ years
* Agile and ""flavor of the month"" business trends where the company makes the methodology or process the goal to be implemented with no real tools or training, but expects the team to follow it and still finish the core project in time
* Race to the bottom in everything you do, while an expectation to grow year over year.  I'm not a late stage capitalism believer, but at some point, can we really expect this?

Won't lie to you, there were days that I was really depressed and desperate, hope that I'd eventually get a job seemed like an illusion, especially after you receive email after email with rejections.It's a **SOUL SUCKING EXPERIENCE! 😢**

I also know there are many many of you here in the same position that I was just before today!

Let me just share some things that I've learned the hard way, on my own, if it helps one of you, it's worth it:

**1)** Give yourself a break - apply for jobs 5 days a week, have the weekend off (PS: seems like job offers during the weekend are a lot less anyway)

**2)** Work out, jog, watch a movie or do anything that brings you joy after your day of applications

**3)** Don't expect a response to every job application, you won't get one.

**4)** ALL of the job rejections are not personal, move as quickly as you can (I've received over a 100 of them)

**5)** DO NOT allow yourself to get sucked into depression and self-pity mode for more than 1 or 2 days. We're all human, we have emotions, we feel desperation, especially in times like this. Make a deal with yourself, if you want/have to feel pity, desperate, sorry, depressed, anxious, anything else, allow yourself to feel that for the day, don't apply to jobs, take a day off, feel it all. But tomorrow, get out of the victim mode, get up, shower, get dressed. It's a new day, new opportunities, start from scratch, forget about all the rejections.

**6)** If you need as you cant take it, turn to a friend, family member, Redditors, anyone that makes you feel safe enough to talk about it.

**7)** As clichè as it sounds - remember, life is always based on ups and downs, this is just (one of the many) downs you'd have, just like all of us.

**8) YOU CAN DO THIS!**

**Optional 9:** Once you get an offer, take some time to reflect on what this period thought you (focus on the positive because we all know that ""it sucked""), but just see what you've learned - either about yourself, the world, people, the market, anything really.

Please, don't give up! **You'd get an offer eventually**, just push through it! 💪🏻

PS: I had an interview with another company just after the offer, I didn't cancel it, I'll leave that door open.

**UPDATE:** After having a discussion with some of you in the comments, I  decided to actually calculate my success rate, here are the numbers:

Total Job applications - 140 

Total interviews - **4 (success rate - 2.85%)** 

**Job offers - 1 (which is a 0.7% success rate** 🤦🏻‍♀️)

237,"Just landed a job after 3 years and over 600 rejections, here's what I wish people told me when I was grad job hunting.",628,8e4eps,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8e4eps/just_landed_a_job_after_3_years_and_over_600/,171,"After 3 years and over 600 failed applications, I've finally landed my first degree-related job (also my dream job - I'm overjoyed!). I'm writing this post to share advice I wish I had been given when I started my graduate job hunt. 

For context (because job hunting varies depending on your location and background!) I'll start by giving an overview of myself:

* I'm a 25-year-old Brittish male living in a small city but willing to relocate.  
* Educated to MSc level in the field of Geography. 
* Partook in a number of extra activities as a student (e.g. member of the Quiz Team, charity volunteering, study abroad).
* Small amount of work experience as a waiter, barman, tutor and admin. 

Here's what I've learned from the graduate job hunting process:  

**1. There is no right or wrong way to produce a CV, go with what feels right for you and don't overthink it** 

There are countless posts online about this topic with people hotly debating the do's and don't's of CV design. I personally showed my CV to three university careers advisers and two recruiters seeking advice and was told radically different things. In short what makes a 'good' CV design is just down to personal preferences. So long as there aren't spelling errors and it shows your contact details, education and work history - nothing else really matters. You won't be viewed badly for mentioning/omitting your hobbies, using post nominals in your name, or for listing your work history before your qualifications. They just want the core info 90% of the time. 

**2. Applying for minimum wage jobs to tide you over is usually pointless**

In the UK, the minimum wage increases with age. Someone aged 25 legally needs to be paid £7.83 an hour whereas a 19-year-old only needs to be paid £5.90. So to employ a 25-year-old worker on minimum wage for a 40-hour week costs an employer over £300 more a month than hiring a teenager. This means that you will automatically be rejected for most minimum wage jobs as companies always seek to cut costs. Employers also know graduates won't stick around so they'll always give preference to people who are starting college or people without good qualifications as it saves them having to rehire. There are exceptions (for example, if you have very relevant experience or personal connections) however as a general tip it's better to just focus on getting actual graduate-level employment. I applied to over two hundred minimum wage jobs and was only successful when someone at the place knew me. 

**3. Expect to be lied to. Don't trust job adverts/recruiters and read reviews**

In the course of my job hunt, I regularly encountered misleading job posting and downright dodgy recruitment practices. It's not uncommon for companies to inflate salaries by through setting unrealistic on target earnings. It's also common to exaggerate how easy it is to get promoted and to place emphasis on the more fun sounding aspects of jobs rather than what you'd actually do on a day to day basis. I also had the misfortune of interviewing for a job, receiving an offer, then finding out the first 6 months were an unpaid ""training academy"". Sadly modern day job hunting is just full of dodgy practices. Before you apply for any job, Google the company and position and try to find reviews. Glassdoor is great for this, Reddit as well at times.

**4. Don't take rejections personally**

There are an insane number of job seekers out there at the moment. Many jobs I applied to received 100+ applicants and my sister recently interviewed for a graduate scheme which had over 5,000 applications for 25 places. With numbers like that even amazing candidates get rejected and it's virtually impossible to give meaningful feedback. Don't fall into the trap of taking it personally. 

**5. Don't try to find logic - there often isn't any**

Recruitment is a very subjective practice and what makes a 'good applicant' varies massively from person to person. For example, I once saw an advert for a company with two identical vacant positions (one in Edinburgh and one in Glasgow). I sent the same CV and cover letter to both offices. The Edinburgh office was ""impressed"" and gave me an interview whereas the Glasgow office said I ""didn't meet the minimum requirements"". This just epitomises how subjective the whole process can be. When decisions are made by low-level recruiters processing dozens of applications there will inevitably be cases where illogical recruitment decisions are made. 

**6. Assume the person reading your CV doesn't know their field well**

When I first started job hunting I assumed that all recruiters knew a lot about the industry/role they were recruiting for. In fact, this is often not true and many recruiters have only a superficial understanding of things as they recruit for such a wide range of roles. For example, I mistakenly expected a recruiter to know that one piece of software (which I was familiar with) was very similar to the software package mentioned in their job posting without having to spell it out. Unless you're emailing directly, don't write your CV/cover letter assuming your hypothetical future boss will read it but write it assuming someone junior in HR or a recruiter with no direct skills will read it. Don't use industry-specific terms, refer to the job description and assume ignorance. 

**7. It's a numbers game, keep at it and you will succeed eventually**

As I said before, good jobs attract literally hundreds of applicants. You need to cast a wide net and keep persevering and eventually you will be the lucky one.

Bit of a long spiel I know but if I can help one person improve their job hunt then this post will have been worth it.

I went for finger prints, drug screen and had even put my notice in at my current job. I ended up calling back and pulling my acceptance of the job. 

After I had gone for my fingerprints and drug screen the whole vibe of the hiring people changed. They were pushy and rude and I kept getting jumped around from supervisor to supervisor, dates kept changing, location of my “home base” office kept changing. And as corny as this may seem, I had a terrible dream that I hated it before training even ended. At this point the only good thing I could see  was the 13k year a raise and I couldn’t take a position JUST for money. 

Of course my job said it was okay to come back since the two weeks wasn’t up, and the place I had the offer for was upset and told me I had lost all chances and to never apply to them or any company who works with them. 

Well of course I put more applications out there, and I ended up interviewing with a non-profit and the next day got offered the position. This job is at a safe house for youth and has such better vibes. It’s more of what I was looking for in “child welfare” and I’m so excited. It’s definitely not as nice of a raise, and is actually a small pay cut from my current position, but something about it just feels right. 

My point of putting this out there is, if you have a weird feeling about a new job, and have the ability to, pull out and don’t do it. something bigger, better and more of what you want is just around the corner.

The fact is that a lot of us, even those of us who are experienced, are figuring things out as we go.  Secondly, no two jobs or organizations are the same, so finding a perfect segue from one job to another is nearly impossible.  To then have to lie about your current experience or abilities to get a job, and then have to live up to these expectations, helps nobody.  

As someone who tries to be forthcoming and honest at work about expectations (and maybe a little too much so), I've seen it hurt my opportunities so many times.  Furthermore, I see people in positions that they should never be in, simply because they were better at selling the lies about where they're genuinely at with regards to skills and experience.  Their inexperience and lack of skill, as a consequence, often hurt morale and productivity of the team they are placed on or oversee.  

In contrast to this, I think the hiring process should be more transparent and forthright from all parties.  Maybe this transparency will lend more to opportunities of getting actual formalized on-the-job training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.  If everyone isn't out there lying or faking it to get a job, then companies would have no choice but to invest in training and development if they want to find the candidates they are seeking.  Furthermore, it'd help morale and productivity on teams because then you're not dealing with the repercussions of a manager or colleague who is out of their element trying to *fake it till they make it*.   

What are your thoughts?  Has faking it till you make it gone too far in the sense that it creates an environment where the best con artist wins out, and then everyone else is forced to deal with the consequences of a poor hiring decision when there are no formal training or mentor programs in place to accommodate?

&#x200B;

To make a very long story short, I worked in a toxic workplace, which became ***extremely*** toxic when ""Bob"" was hired on as a new tier of management no one needed. We were all optimistic, though, but it became clear within a few weeks that this guy was no good. He lied, committed fraud, tried to get people to commit fraud, accused someone of committing fraud for refusing to commit fraud, caused in-fighting by blaming things on others, basically made fun of my weight (in a kinda backwards way), etc. all the while wearing a shit-eating grin the likes of which a creepypasta villain would be proud of. In the span of a year, five of the twelve-person team was either out on burnout leave or pre-burnout therapy. People were crying in their offices on a regular basis (I'm talking several times a week, here). It was bad.

&#x200B;

We finally banded together. 11 out of 12 employees filed a complaint against him, although despite my insistence to do so, we didn't involve our unions. The one employee who did not file a complaint would have, but she'd applied for his position so she felt it was a conflict of interest. She did, however, contribute to our meetings and the ""file"" we had on him. I have a six-page document detailing my personal experiences with this guy as well as a 2-page bullet point list of all my grievances. Everyone else had similarly long lists of complaints.

&#x200B;

The employer did *nothing*. A small slap on the wrist, that's it.

&#x200B;

I came in one Monday morning, had a panic attack for the first time in my life (legit thought I was dying, holy fuck), and the big-big boss forced me to go to the health clinic on campus and I was given two weeks burnout leave. This was my breaking point. Just thinking about that day still fills me with angst. To this day, I'm still feeling after-effects of the burnout. ANYWAYS, I was done. I applied for a job at the government and a few months later, thank Zeus, I was hired.

&#x200B;

At that point, the toxic manager had taken a temporary assignment elsewhere on campus, but I was done done DONE. I left. **I took a significant pay cut to get away from this guy** and that place.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I found peace and happiness in a workplace that values me. This was over a year ago. It has been wonderful. It has been zen. I went from falling into an endless chasm of darkness any time family members asked me how work was, to sending emails about how happy I was and how great this place is on a regular basis!

&#x200B;

And then yesterday, I overheard Bob's name and tried to convince myself I misheard, because it sounded like someone was telling my boss that Bob was going to be his office neighbor. And then heard Bob's voice, and I freaked out. Like, body-shaking, nearly screaming-sobs, tears leaking all over the place freaking out (thankfully I'd somehow kept it together long enough to duck into a colleague's office).

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do.

&#x200B;

My colleagues were super understanding (and got my boss to explain the situation) and they were all very supportive and protective of me and swore up and down if he so much as stepped one foot out of line, they'd report it, but I'm still scared.

&#x200B;

I'm scared because I can't deal with being around him.

I'm scared because he might want to retaliate for the whole reporting him at my old job thing.

I'm scared because I feel like I'm losing the happiness I needed after seven years in hell.

I'm scared to leave my cubicle for fear of seeing him.

I'm just scared.

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do. I *love* my job. That's something I haven't been able to say in a really REALLY long time. I'm supported here, appreciated (my boss calls me a rockstar), the environment is nice and healthy...but I don't think I can handle being around this guy. I don't have any history of anxiety or depression or anything like that. This kind of thing has never happened to me in my life.

&#x200B;

What do I do? Do I quit? Do I go talk to HR and ask for accommodations? Like ""Hey listen I have a really bad history with this person, I want to make sure I am NEVER in a room alone with him and not get penalized for that.""? I don't know what to do.

This time is different. Back in July, I interviewed for a chemical company, but wasn't selected for the job. I shrugged it off and went back to looking, because I was too used to it to even get upset. About two weeks ago, I interviewed for a tech startup as a lab tech and was offered the job less than two hours later by email. It only paid $10 an hour, but I was done with pizza delivery so I didn't even care. I put in my two weeks and agreed to start on the 19th.

253,Hiring manager emailed me after I posted an unflattering Glassdoor review... a cautionary tale?,611,iwr5jj,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/iwr5jj/hiring_manager_emailed_me_after_i_posted_an/,123,"UPDATE: Thanks for the support y'all! After nice encouragement from several people, I did update my review to include the inappropriate follow-up email. Good luck to everyone looking for a job out there.

3 months ago, I applied for a job and heard back right away. I underwent 5 interviews and 2 tests over the course of a month, and I was actually being considered for 2 roles there. By the final interview, it looked promising that I would get offered at least 1 of the 2 jobs. For instance, we hammered out when I could start and the top manager said he didn't want to delay an offer. I was really excited.

Here's where things hit a snag. The top manager emailed me to say he had major reservations about bringing me on because my pay history is higher than what they can offer. I told him I was still very much interested in working there and unbothered since I would be gaining new and valuable skills. He then claimed he would be camping without wifi for several days and would need time to think it all through. A disappointing turn, but I held hope.

After not hearing back for a few weeks, the momentum was officially lost. It seemed like I was on the back burner, at best. I mentally made peace with not getting the job(s). But, I followed up anyway to ask if there was any other information I could provide toward a decision.

He replied and directly told me that my past salary had been the reason communications came to a halt--but he was ""willing to reconsider."" We were back in business, as I saw it. I gave a desired number, which was at the upper end of the wiggle room he stated, and waited to hear my fate, nervous every time I refreshed my email. No email that week. No email the next. Finally, no email for a month.

Since he'd already outright told me that they were iffy about hiring me, the message was loud and clear. They weren't jumping on it and any eagerness on their end had soured. The chance of an actual offer materializing at this point seemed slim to nil, especially since the last interview had been 2 months prior. I just figured I asked for too much. It's like when you don't get *turned down* for a second date, but you know their feelings based on the lack of interest in setting up another. It's a slow realization and it sucks.

I accepted that it was really time to move on, but I'm an anxious nelly and not having a firm conclusion after so much hope and interview prep did nag at me. To put some closure on it for myself, I left a short, unemotional review on Glassdoor. (I also did this to see reviews of other companies in full.) In this anonymous review, I wrote that I was left hanging after an involved process and that my impression of management is that they're a bit disorganized and disrespectful of candidates' time (more to the story, but I'll stick to the main points here). It was not intended to be a big condemnation--just a mental bookend that would force me to let it go and focus on other opportunities.

A week later, I get a message from the top manager who ghosted me twice! He had obviously seen the review and gave what was at its core a strange defense of his silence, arguing that the woman who oversaw the position has been hospitalized---conveniently for a month---with some unknown illness that is ""very serious."" It was something of a kiss off too.

Needless to say, I didn't reply. I wish her well if that's the truth, but it came across like a dramatic story to get the last word and make me feel like I'd shot myself in the foot. Hell, maybe I did, I just felt like they'd already burned the bridge *with me* by not having the courtesy to respond.

Am I crazy to think this was some face-saving BS claim he made only because I can never verify it? What was I to believe, with a month of radio silence that came after the previous 3 weeks of silence--on top of him explicitly telling me they had cooled off on the idea of hiring me. I mean, was I supposed to chase down a job that had already given me the brushoff twice? Just an update would have been nice if they were actually interested.

Lesson learned though! Next time, I will let things keep fading if they're already going in that direction. I will find a new inner grace that doesn't require concrete closure. I will remember that patience is key and I shouldn't make assumptions or fill in the blanks with what someone else is thinking.

TL;DR: Hiring manager went radio silent on me twice after a lengthy interview process. I assumed (maybe prematurely?) that I was ghosted. I left a Glassdoor review to get closure for myself and he audaciously replied via email with what I strongly suspect is a sob story.

Thank you kind people of r/jobs.",607,darrm4,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/darrm4/after_months_of_unemployment_taking_temp_minimum/,44,"Long-time lurker here on this sub-reddit and I have been motivated by all the advice, life-lessons, and positive growth experiences by the determined, helpful, and empathetic people in this community. I have been looking for an entry-level legal position as an immigrant (US permanent resident with mostly international experience) and US active duty military spouse (who suffered lots of bias in interviews on this front), for over 8 months, out of which 4 months were of complete unemployment and full-time networking and job seeking. Since we live in the DC area, law jobs that do not require a security clearance are limited (within my field of work) and given that I am not a US Citizen, I have attended close to 200 interviews and been rejected by 40% of these due to being unable to get secret clearance (although my permanent residence status is written clearly on my resume.) I was also rejected from about 50% of these jobs for being too “over-qualified” for legal support positions even though I have not undertaken any Bar exam and am clearly an entry-level candidate. 

I am so excited to have landed a legal secretary position with an international law firm. Although I know that I would be underemployed given that I do have a law degree, I am so grateful to be given the opportunity to have a foot in the door of a dream firm within my dream career of international law and dispute resolution. Hopefully, I can work my way up from here and (especially as a military spouse with potential job breaks due to relocations) I am glad to close the gap in my resume since graduating law school in January of this year! 
This, to me, is definitely a HUGE leg up from working minimum wage jobs that extended all the way from retail to basic data entry just to pay the bills although I had no passion for it and though these had nothing to do with my education and career goals.

A lot of this is because of this great community through this sub-reddit. I can not express how grateful I am for all of you. You’ve gotten me through my toughest days and provided me with the strength to move closer to self-fulfilment. Thank you.",1569768410.0,2019-09-29 10:46:50

If you need to, take a humbling job to get your foot in the door. Your degree shows your knowledge and willingness to pursue what you're passionate in, and to an extent, it shows your work ethic. However, it's not a ""get a good job now"" pass. As someone who has graduated in the past five years, I started with a dog shit job, getting horrible pay, and no benefits. Within a year I had received a large raise and given permanent status. In another year I had left that company for a higher paying still shitty job. After another six months of that, I left for my current job. I love where I work now, the pay and benefits are fantastic, my boss is an incredible example. I love it all.

I promise you none of this would have ever happened, if I didn't sit down and say ""I need to stop trying to run before I walk"", and take that first horrible humbling position. This isn't a post to say ""shame on you and your ambitions"", it's just to remind you that we all need to start some where. I've told a lot of struggle friends this advice and each have gone through the motions that I did; now are all working in a job they love.

I went through over a month of interviews and had my references checked only to be told they went with an internal candidate instead. I understand the silver lining that I was able to make it far in the process but ultimately, what bugs me the most is the time invested. More often than not, the internal candidate was already their top contender. They know the company, it's easy to get references from their team members, etc. It's disappointing that some companies essentially string candidates along because they have to open and interview external candidates as part of their policies with no real intention of hiring from the outside.

To add onto the ridiculousness, said company had asked if it would be possible for me to get an extension with another offer I already had. I foolishly did last week and today, I find out the other company rescinded my offer and gave it to another candidate. Now, I'm back to square one with nothing except months of interviews that led nowhere and offer that was rescinded.

Is there a reason companies do this? Drag out the interview process and get the hopes up of prospective candidates only to say - ""Oh by the way, we're going internal instead."" It's almost as though our time isn't as valuable as theirs. I don't know.

This left a bad impression of the company and their management, at least the team I interviewed with. Makes you wonder how they treat their actual staff.

263,Getting out of mandatory “fun” like lip sync battles.,598,c6nlf4,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c6nlf4/getting_out_of_mandatory_fun_like_lip_sync_battles/,168,"I posted about my organization having us participate in a mandatory lip sync battle [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/c2lzjn/how_do_i_politely_and_tactfully_get_out_of_a_lip/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&utm_term=control_2)

So I tackled this by just ignoring the fact that it was going to happen. My team leader for the activity sent an email invite last Monday for a rehearsal practice. I declined and nothing came of it. Tuesday morning rolls along and there’s an invite sent at 6:00am for rehearsal number two. Attached is a document with assigned dance moves and lyrics. I sent the decline. As the day moves closer to the assigned practice time everything remains quiet. I’m about to head to lunch when I stand up in my cubicle and turn around to see the team leader. 

Me: “Hey coworker, how can I help you?”

Lip sync leader: “Yeah, so the team has practice today at 1:30. We’ve got a lot to accomplish before showtime on Thursday”

Me: “It’s great that you’re taking the lead on this and I hope you guys have a lot of fun but this is a hard no for me”

Lip sync leader: “I’m not sure that’s an option. The culture committee said everyone’s expected to participate and Deb already has a pass because of her asthma so the team’s losing 5 points because of her”.

Me: “Look man, I’ve got donor meetings and proposals to make before the holiday weekend. I’m not going to be doing the lip sync battle. If the culture committee has a problem with my absence feel free to direct them my way”. 

Lip sync leader: “We’ll see”. 

Then he walked away. So the week continues and I still get invites to lip sync meetings and decline until people in my actual department approach me. 

Coworker: “So what kind of dance are responsible for”?

Me: “I had to put my foot down, man. I’m not doing the lip sync deal”.

Coworker: “Okay, sure. I’m confident we’ll see you out there. You’re not the type to let your teammates lose points because you don’t like lip syncing”.

Me: “They can say ‘no’ too. Besides, I’m not in a position where I feel like it’s necessary to sing and dance for my job. If the choice seriously comes down to performing in a recorded lip sync battle or looking for a new job, the choice is pretty clear”.

So the time of the lip sync battle finally arrives and an announcement comes over the PA system telling us all to assemble for the picnic and lip sync battle. The fundraising team has designated offices for donor calls so I casually enter one and start dialing. 15 minutes roll by and another announcement comes over the PA stating that they still don’t have everyone outside. I’m still calling donors.  

The announcements stop and as I’m making calls I can hear various pop songs from the courtyard. I get on the phone with a long time supporter and he asks me how I’m doing. I look outside and see my lip sync team dancing in 95 degree weather as three executive “judges” take notes. I take a sip of an ice cold Diet Coke. “I’m having a great day, Mr Supporter, how about you”?

As the phone calls go on I notice that my apprehension about missing the lip sync battle has turned into something resembling schadenfreude. I’m having a peaceful, productive day while my colleagues are serving as dancing bears for upper management. I can’t help but smirk as I see Jeremy from legal perform the  daddy shark portion of “Baby Shark” while the Executive director and her lackeys snicker and eat hot dogs. 

One team of employees performs, then the next. This continues for a solid 90 minutes before my beleaguered colleagues return to their desks. The accountants and customer service reps walk by the phone room and glare at me. I remember that I have a meeting with my manager and our team in 15 minutes. I end the phone conversation I’m working on and prepare. 

At the meeting my coworkers are quiet. Their faces are read and the smell of sweat and cheap cookout food fill the conference room. We go over plans for the next few fundraising campaigns and talk about administrative stuff. After about 20 minutes my counterpart turns to me and asks why I didn’t have to participate in the “team building” activity today. I chuckle, look her in the eyes and say “Because I said ‘no’”.

That’s the moral of the story. You can’t let people - especially senior managers - guilt you into doing things like this at work. So far I’ve had no repercussions other than the occasional mention that my coworker’s team won the competition because “everyone participated and loved the organizational values to creat a high energy experience”.

We've already had three job openings at reddit this past year, including this one for [sales support position posted today](http://redd.it/1wwfgi). We've had great success finding awesome candidates in /r/ForHire and relevant local subreddits, but we're seeing some common mistakes over and over again. I thought I'd share some of the most common ones we've seen in the thousand or so applications we've triaged this year.  

Hope these tips are helpful in your search.  Will answer any questions in the comments:

* Name your damn files. If you are attaching or uploading files (resume/cover letter/etc) put your name in filename. I now have 200 files on my computer called resume.doc, and a bunch with even worse labels like summer_2013_webjobs_resume.pdf.  

* Don't apply for a full time job while you are in high school or college unless you have a really good reason. Appreciate the confidence, but you're most likely wasting both of our time.  

* If you have non-traditional experience that you feel would help you do the job you're applying for, that's excellent, but it's up to you to explain how the experience would relate. Don't assume people will understand jargon from a different industry in your resume no matter how impressive. Make your case in the cover letter and resume itself. have a friend who is not in the industry read over it and make sure they understand any jargon etc.        

* Showing a sense of humor can be great in the right context, but if you have any doubts, err on the side of caution. A bad joke can be a deal killer.  

* Speak directly to the job description being offered. It's often clear from the resume and cover letter that applicants didn't really read the job description. Are you right for this particular job, or are you just interested in the company, location, etc.?  

* Don't talk about how you really wanted to be a film director, game designer, zoo keeper, etc but just couldn't cut it (unless there was like a career ending injury or something else outside your control). Everyone can relate, but it's not really your best look.  

* Spelling and grammar matter. You don't have to be 100% perfect, but sloppiness is a killer.  

* Even if the job is open to relocation, local candidates will most likely be favored. If you are not local, be convincing about how relocating won't be an issue.   

* Get someone to look over your resume and anything else in your application. A second opinion is always a good idea.  

* If there are truly optional fields, you should have a good reason to skip. Why pass up a chance to make your case?  

* If you are not applying for an hourly job, don't include what you made hourly for past positions on your resume.

272,Should I be ashamed that I am NOT ambitious and eager to climb the career ladder?,593,gpqje6,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gpqje6/should_i_be_ashamed_that_i_am_not_ambitious_and/,138,"Hey there. I have been thinking about this for quite some time now. Multiple comments and interactions with various people, both from my own family, friends and colleagues over the years have prompted me to think:

**Should I be ashamed that I am NOT ambitious and eager to climb the career ladder? Am I a loser in life for not placing more emphasis on my career?**

A little background about myself. I'm a teacher, and I graduated from a UK university in 2014 with first-class honours. Since then, I have been working as a teacher at a public secondary school.

A good number of my coursemates and also other teachers all seem to be planning their career developments very aggressively, from pursuing Masters while working full-time as teachers, participating and presenting papers in seminars and conferences, creating modules, conducting camps, etc etc......while I on the other hand am pretty.....*chill* about it.

Every year, all the time that I have during school holidays is solely dedicated to planning my lessons far ahead so that  I don't have to crack my head when school is in session. You can say I'm quite obsessed with planning. I'm very organised and I absolutely hate doing ad-hoc things. In fact, I even push myself to prepare materials for the entire year of club meetings even when it's not confirmed yet if I would be the club advisor, just because I like to plan.

It has benefited me so far, and because of this, I have a fairly good work-life balance. My life for the past few years up to now has relatively little stress. I come home from work in the afternoon, exercise in the evening, then dedicate a good 2 hours to read my beloved Kindle. And that's my cycle for the entire year. I don't go the extra mile. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely finish all the tasks required of me, it's just that first,  I don't like to procrastinate and like to get things done quick and second, I'm not married, so I guess I'm lucky in the sense that I have more time.

My lack of ambition wouldn't have bothered me, if not for the fact that people in the education sector (fellow teachers) AND also people OUTSIDE the education sector seem to have this perception that teachers should be noble beings who must sacrifice for students. I'm sorry, while I do care and try to help my kids where possible, I am just not one of those teachers who live and breathe school. If I go back at 3pm, I'm not going to think about school any longer. I think about other things, like planning my weekend grocery list, which cinema movies to look out for, books to read, etc etc

Because I graduated with first-class honours, my former lecturers, coursemates and even my own family feel that I am wasting away my talent and that I should do *something*. They seem to think that I shouldn't be content with what I am doing now. It's annoying as the ""clock"" is ticking and the pressure from them is increasing in the form of off-hand comments, and in turn I am often forced to plaster the world's worst fake smile. As a result, I have begun to feel like a loser lately, like I'm drifting aimlessly even though I am satisfied and happy with my life (little stress)

**TLDR; So I am asking the rest of you, should I be more ambitious? Is something wrong with me for going against the norm? Is it even a norm that one must progress in their career?**",1590359298.0,2020-05-24 18:28:18

This guy wasn't a super bully, no shoving into lockers or anything, but he made my school life pretty unpleasant for two years and never had a nice thing to say to me.

I'm probably just going to ignore his message, but I kind of wanted to vent a little about it and maybe get some feedback from others this may have happened to.",1605135112.0,2020-11-11 17:51:52
275,First day at McDonald's- My experience,590,badc20,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/badc20/first_day_at_mcdonalds_my_experience/,84,"TLDR *down below*

&#x200B;

***About Me***

&#x200B;

I'm a teenager (under 18), recently completed my GED, got my first job to save up for college expenses, and doing some programs at a 2 year college before I'm enrolled for the fall semester.

&#x200B;

***My Personal Tips about Going to the Interview or Orientation***

&#x200B;

1. Be friendly at the interview. My hiring manager was friendly with me back and I think it definitely was the main reason why I got the job.
2. Take notes at orientation. It helped me a lot.

I wish I had more tips but I don't know what else to say.

&#x200B;

***The Interview***

&#x200B;

I went to an interview about a week ago and got the job on the spot. Although, I think he did that with everyone. In my experience the interview was pretty easy and went well. I didn't really prepare myself for the interview in terms of how I would answer the questions being asked. I would recommend studying the questions and rehearsing answers in your head or out loud, but I didn't do this because I was kind of lazy.

&#x200B;

You can most likely wing the interview if you just answer questions on the top of your head and make it sound good enough. Although, this might not be the case with your hiring manager since every hiring manager is different. I think I just got lucky.

&#x200B;

***Orientation***

&#x200B;

The orientation wasn't what I expected. I didn't ask about orientation at the interview besides where it was at and what time it would be, which was my mistake. I expected it to be hands on but it was completely different.

&#x200B;

I showed up to orientation ten minutes early to get my paperwork in and be registered (I think, I don't really know to be honest). I just showed up early because I was told to. It didn't really take long to do paperwork, verify my ID, SS, and a void check. It took maybe 7 or 8 minutes for me.

&#x200B;

I showed up to the room it was in and it ended up being a classroom setting with some longer (3 person) desks and a projector. For about two hours, we took notes, asked and answered questions, learned about working at McDonald's, and basically what you would do at school or something

&#x200B;

Right after class was over, we got our uniforms. Uniforms were simple and nice looking, but nothing special. Black denim pants, a black shirt, and a black hat. We didn't get shoes though, which I was expecting.

&#x200B;

***Before the First Day and Something that was a Pain in the Ass***

&#x200B;

Before my first day, I tried logging into Our Lounge and that was so annoying. It failed every time I tried when I signed into it with my gmail, facebook, and Microsoft account even after 24 hours. It ended up working this morning though out of the blue for some reason. That was really the only annoying thing that I experienced before work.

&#x200B;

I also was scheduled to work yesterday, but couldn't show up due to reasons and the store manager was nice enough to let me start today instead. She even said it would be better since it was on the weekend.

&#x200B;

***My First Day***

&#x200B;

Even though I was super nervous about my interview and orientation, I felt calm and just fine before starting my first shift. If you can do well in the interview and orientation, you'll most likely do fine on the job.

&#x200B;

The first thing I did there was meet the manager and my crew trainer and also did a few modules on the computer. The modules weren't that bad since there were only five the manager had me do and they took about 30 minutes for me to complete.

&#x200B;

After I was done with that, I took out the trash. The crew trainer helped me with this, thank god, because I probably would get the job done really slow if he didn't guide me. He was good at explaining things for me and helping me out with stuff. After that, I swept and wiped tables, which was the easiest task that I did on my first day. I didn't really need training for that.

&#x200B;

I got put on the register like an hour after I started working there, which I did not expect. I did so-so on the register. I had to get the manager a lot to void an item because I made a mistake on the order. It was kind of embarrassing to me since I felt dumb fucking up so many times, but no one treated me like shit because of it and were nice about it.

&#x200B;

After doing register, I helped with putting food items into the right bags and practiced making smoothies. That wasn't too hard but I was a little slow at doing that. I took a break for about 30 minutes after that. When I got done, I swept again, cleaned tables, did more of the register, and so on.

&#x200B;

Towards the end of my shift, I learned about making fries and putting them in the box, and also made someone's order of coffee before I left.

&#x200B;

Overall, a basic, somewhat challenging, but simple day at work.

&#x200B;

***Tips About Your First Day on the Job***

&#x200B;

1. Don't sweat the small stuff. Of course it's your first day and you're not going to be as efficient or good at the tasks as someone who's worked there a while. As long as you listen, pay attention, and at least act interested in what you're doing, the workers are pretty cool and understanding.
2. If you're working register, apologize for simple mistakes. Customers have been really friendly towards me once I apologized and explained my situation. Not all customers are like this and some people can just be assholes because they just want to be. Luckily, I haven't had any bad experiences with the customers so far. If someone is an asshole towards you, just remember that they're probably not happy with their own life and are taking their own shit out on you. It reflects more poorly on the asshole customers than it does on you 99.95% of the time.
3. Ask questions even if you've gone over it or it's a simple question. No question is a dumb question. Also, it makes your employees think that you're interested in your job.
4. Drink soda by the soda fountain if you're manager only allows you to drink water. That's my case and people working there just gulp down a soda, throw the evidence away, and get back to work. Not all managers are like this though.
5. I also learned from my crew trainer not to confront meth heads going to the bathroom to get high.

***Positive Things about My First Day at McDonald's***

&#x200B;

1. My coworkers today were cool.
2. The customers are mostly nice at the McDonald's I work at.
3. One lady that was really nice to me today was a single mother of three. At first I was expecting her to be a little irritable and in a rush, understandably dealing with three young children. She ended up being super nice though. I had trouble with the register and she said that she could order from the kiosk (in a nice way though). On top of that, she had a really friendly tone and was amazing just in general. I made sure to thank her while she was sitting down and she said it was fine and that she had experience being trained on the first day.
4. Customers that were either around my age or elderly were pretty cool too.
5. I paid only $1.93 including taxes for a big mac combo meal while I was on shift.

&#x200B;

***Some Not So Positive but Not So Negative Things about My First Day***

&#x200B;

1. I had a few people mumble while they ordered and I had to ask them multiple times what they said.
2. You have to get a manager to void an item. Annoying and inconvenient.
3. I had one guy complain about the bathroom being dirty and a ""mess"" even though there was only water around the sink/ on the floor and had soap on the sink. He said that he couldn't even use it. My crew trainer had to explain to him that only maintenance can clean the bathroom and crew members aren't allowed to do so.
4. I was a bit awkward first starting on the register. I was struggling with the register, pausing in between what I said, and my ""thank you"" was too long according to my crew trainer. He didn't say it in a mean way, just a joking way. He said that he was awkward too when he first started working the register, so that made me feel a little better.
5. My crew trainer said that he's had a gun pointed at him and fries thrown on him. Shows that customers can be crazy.

&#x200B;

***Cool Things about Working There***

&#x200B;

1. You get a discount on a lot of things through McD perks. I went on it today and saw cars, phone plans, movie tickets, groceries, etc. being discounted.
2. You get 75% off your meal on shift. (Don't eat the food there every day though)
3. It looks good on your resume when applying to other fast food/restaurant/retail jobs.

&#x200B;

***TLDR; be friendly, you don't have to practice a mock interview to get the job, take notes at orientation, be calm and attentive on the first day, Our Lounge is a pain in the ass, cut yourself some slack on the first day, apologize for simple mistakes, you might be put on the register the first day (so be prepared for that), prepare to deal with rude or annoying customers, and always listen to your crew trainer.***

&#x200B;

Small Note: I wrote this here to share my experience with people who are starting their first fast food job, are interested in working fast food, or are just curious about this subject in general. I hope this post can reassure and comfort some people who are stressed out or nervous about their first job and make them feel like they don't have to worry as much.

&#x200B;

Another note: If it's not too much, to ask I would appreciate some critique on my writing and also my grammar. I just created a reddit account and I want to post on here some more.

&#x200B;

Edit: Not sure if this is the right flair or not but I just decided to put job searching since it was the closest thing.


Edit #2 (4/7/2019): Today was a good day! The only rude customer I dealt with today was an older lady who asked me if I worked at McD's because I couldn't find anywhere else to work. I was nice and just told her that I work there because of the benefits. She then told me I would get nowhere in life being a leech. I was thinking ""what the fuck, did she really just say that"", but I had to be nice and told her to enjoy her meal. Annoying, but nothing too bad.

Also, today was much easier. Only called the manager to void an item on the register once! And I learned how to make McCafe drinks, handled the fries, and brought some stock to the front of the kitchen. Also did the usual of cleaning tables, sweeping, being at the register, taking out the trash, etc.


Another positive thing today was that one of my coworkers said I smelled good. I was expecting to smell of sweat and BO, so that was nice to hear.

Last summer, I lost my job. The Friday before my wedding anniversary and my birthday. For five month, I came to /r/jobs nearly every day to get inspiration and read-up on advice. I promised myself I would share a follow-up to my unemployment as I've encountered too many threads where OP would ask for advice, and I never heard back from them. 

Not much about this post will be original at all, but here are a few points that I had to learn the hard way that I hope may help you on your journey. 

#Context
Earlier this year, I started a 1-year contract role that I'm somewhat enjoying (has its own issues). I'm technically being paid more too, but I lack benefits in exchange. I was making $70k w/ benefits. I now make $90k without benefits. I live in Canada, so this is less of an issue. I lost my job at a small tech company and landed my self this contract role at a much more prominent tech company in marketing. 

#Numbers
According to my personal Google Docs tracker, I applied to 109 jobs. I heard back from 27 places (positive and negative responses). I got 13 interviews (in-person and phone). And I got 3-ish official offers. 

- Response Rate: 24.7%
- Interview Rate: 11.9%
- Offer Rate: 2.7%

#Here are a few things I wish I knew.

1. **No one is immune to getting fired, and you are not alone** — in an attempt to prevent from spiralling further into depression, I met with as many people I could that I knew had experienced being laid off. Many of these people were more than willing to meet with me, give me advice, offer to help, and most importantly, they shared their story with me. I heard about some friends who had been employed for nine months to almost a year and a half after laid off again after eight months of unemployment. It happens to anyone and everyone, and you can be the best damn person at your job, and it could happen to you. **You are not alone, you are not worthless.**

2. **Resumes are read by recruiters first, not the hiring manager. So write your damn resume for the recruiter.** — This is typical advice but hear me out. Instead of writing your resume with the hiring manager in mind, write it for the recruiter. Write it for someone who is probably unaware of the technical intricacies of your role, someone who is literally ""Ctrl + F""-ing through your resume looking for acronyms (i.e. HTML5, CSS3, SEM, SEO). A good recruiter knows the role and possibly a bit of the technical specifics. But MOST recruiters are not like that. **You're going to need to dumb it down and use their language.** If they use SEO/SEM, don't write it out, just use, verbatim, what they use. You'll notice an ignorant level of the same kinds of terms recycled among different recruiters. Also depending on your industry, but keep your resume clear and concise, and it's more likely to be read. I stuck with a one-pager resume. 

3. **If you're going from fulltime to hourly, figure your rate out before they ask.** — By God's grace, I had a buddy who helped walk me through this. He's an IT contract working and knows this world very well, so he was able to give me this advice. **If you're going from full time to hourly/contract, calculate your hourly rate as a full-time employer, and add 20-30% on top of it.** The buffer makes up for things contract workers miss, such as vacation pay, benefits, company perks, etc. So, for example, I was making around $75k, which means my full-time the hourly rate was $36. My hourly contact rate should then be around $45 bucks to make up for the rest. Do I wish that I was full time and not contract? Sure, but I've got a great opportunity at a decent fortune 500 company with people I know, that's not a bad trade-off. 

4. **Give the interview your all. You know that feeling when you're talking so passionately; you get shivers down your spine? Do that.** — You need to be different from any other interviewer. And that means passion, what's going to set you apart is, yeah sure, your experience, and your achievements. But if you can show me that you're someone I want to work with, and you're going to roll with the punches when things get hard, that's going to stand out much more than a few words on a piece of paper. That helped me get to the offer stage. This comes naturally because I'm a comfortable public speaker and extrovert, but you can do it too. **Because you have nothing to lose, so feel those shivers.**

#To Sum It Up
If you're feeling shitty, and worst of all, if you're feeling suicidal. You can do this. You can fucking do it. Keep your head up. I believe in you, everyone here believes in you. The hardest part is getting your ass going, so just do it, because you have nothing to lose and everything to gain. 

Losing my job was the most humbling experience I have ever gone through. And I hated every moment of it, but I cannot lie, that it has changed me for the better. I am more compassionate; I am more understanding, I am more thankful for the job I have. 

Could it probably happen again in the future? Yeah it could, I am on a one year contract, but you know what? I've done it before, and I'll fucking do it again. 

#You can do this. You can really do it. Keep going. Don't stop.

285,The sweet taste of quitting.,581,jhnyjd,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jhnyjd/the_sweet_taste_of_quitting/,79,"I put my two weeks in a couple days ago to start working at a startup. The company I work at is taking advantage of employees.  They used COVID as a way to lay off people they wanted to fire. Everyone that remained ended doing multiple roles, typically 2-4. We are considered an essential business. Work did not slow down for us. I saw my highest sales numbers during this summer. I continuously asked for support to do my role and was eventually told they were not hiring anyone and that I’d have to manage on my own. 

My resignation completely caught management off guard. They can f*ck themselves. After laying off so many employees, and not giving out promised raises, not offering any type of additional Covid compensation for working through all this, and cutting overtime; management is going on their yearly Presidents trip. This is the most unethical place I’ve ever worked at, and it feels AMAZING to leave.

I’m posting this because I feel so much relief in leaving. This was one of the hardest roles I’ve worked.  And I spent two years of my life there, being at the edge of sanity daily. I can put up with a lot of crap. I will push through to better myself. But no matter what I did, or how much I tried to put up with, nothing ever seemed to improve. Quitting was the only option to keep my sanity. 

For those in a similar situation, know that you can get out. These are scary times, but there are companies wanting to hire. USE YOUR NETWORK! It’s one of the best ways to find opportunities.",1603631647.0,2020-10-25 09:14:07

I know that my resume is gold, and so are my interview skills. If you're highly motivated and consistent with the application & research process while also taking advantage of all your resources at the same time, all this rejection likely has absolutely NOTHING to do with you. 


(I truly wonder why I don't get these jobs sometimes: I'm overqualified, I'll work for less and I even send thank-you notes after interviews...)
Bottom line: There are many reasons why you didn't get called back for another interview or why they virtually threw it in the trash before it hit their desk -- none of them mean you have low value or aren't employable. The testament to how hard you want it just proves how much value you've got in a world of endless work!

289,Rant to Employers with High Turnover,571,cuhvop,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cuhvop/rant_to_employers_with_high_turnover/,145,"1. You expect full communication from an employee about their position? How about a little communication with an applicant as to why his application was rejected? It takes time and effort researching your company and filling out your application. How hard is it to send a short, sweet email stating what was wrong/undesirable?
2. You want an applicant to fill out an application then come in for an interview before disclosing your 'competitive' pay-rate, because your pay-rate flat out sucks. You just wasted the time of both of us, and I'm leaving as soon as something better comes along, most likely without notice.
3. When an employee brings exceptional value to your company, be sure to reward that employee fairly. Example: I went above and beyond my job duties to do something no one else even thought of doing during downtime. I gained the company an additional $27,000 in assets over the quarter and didn't even receive a measly $0.25 raise because I was 'capped out' at a pathetic $15 an hour.
4. When you promise an employee a promotion that also comes with a pay raise, don't leave that employee hanging in his current position for 3 months with the old, tired excuse of 'were working on it'. That just tells me that I was doing my job to well and you're just providing me lip-service to keep me around until I wisen-up to your game.
5. When you have a highly productive worker, don't force him to 'train' employees that clearly aren't going to stay. This leads to burn out because he still not only has to do his job, he also has to pick up the slack of someone who doesn't care. You can at the very least throw this employee a quarterly bonus for the extra effort.
6. If you expect an employee to work overtime a full year before receiving any paid time off, don't get upset when that employee starts calling off and showing up late. Work is only a PART of life, work is NOT life!
7. Don't discriminate against an applicant because he has a history of only staying several months at a time with companies. You as an employer aren't going to keep an employee that's losing the company money, and I as an employee am not going to remain 'loyal' to a company that isn't compensating me fairly.
8. When it comes time for review and you offer me a $0.25 raise, don't expect me to stick around three more months until my next review. After tax, a $0.25 raise is an extra $8.25 per WEEK. If I've proven through my work and my attitude to be a valuable employee, you need to offer a raise that will at the very least start paying for my gas to get back and forth to work each week.
9. Last but not least, you get what you pay for. If you aren't willing to invest in talent, then I hope you enjoy running a company full of lazy, unreliable people, because that's all you're going to attract.

With all of that said, I am feeling a little better now. As for my job search, well, the workforce in general has just lost one more talented individual, as I saved up enough money to take my part-time business full-time. Goodbye corporate America. Honestly can't say that I'm going to miss you.",1566613876.0,2019-08-23 22:31:16

291,I no longer care about working at Google or any other huge company.,568,9f26lv,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9f26lv/i_no_longer_care_about_working_at_google_or_any/,285,"I am a web developer with a cushy, comfortable job only making $70k in the Bay Area. It isn't much, but it's stress free. I’m severely underpaid, but the fact that I get freedom to do and code whatever I want all day makes up for that.  PHP and JavaScript all day, deadlines are all a month out, not a care in the world. All I have to do is show up and get paid.

I have an interview with Google next month and you know what? I no longer care.

I'm tired. These interviews for FAANG and the big four or big five or whatever are all ridiculous. I literally don't care about linked lists or binary trees. I'll never use them, even if I work at Google. I know how to code. I know what time complexity is. Honestly that should be enough.

But it has to be some big production with some big dog and pony show.

Is it even that serious? Was it ever that serious?

At this point I'd rather continue working cushy, easy web development jobs while working on my business. I don't have a startup, I have a small business (related to fixing mobile phones) that I do in my free time. My goal is to make it take off.

Why should I stress myself with studying for these ridiculous interviews when plenty of companies (like the one I'm working at now) have interview processes that make sense?

For my current role I had two interviews. One was over the phone just so that they could get a feel for me. The last was coming in for a white board and sit down. The whiteboard questions were super basic algos just to make sure I could actually code. During the sit down they got to know me and asked me questions about JavaScript and PHP. 1.5 hours. That was it. Two days later they called and said I got the job.

That's how it should be.

But Google wants to put people through rounds and rounds and rounds of interviews just to get rejected.

Where do they get off? Is it for their egos?

Anyone feel this way?",1536734895.0,2018-09-12 02:48:15

I should have stayed where I was, I had more knowledge and lots of space to grow as junior. Suddenly I reached the same position of late 30s coworkers with several years in the company. What could go wrong?

Well, I panicked. I mean I did delivered the basic but I wasnt ready for autonomy. Being an Excel blackbelt did not save my ass.

3 months later I got laid off. I wasn't performing as I should, the lost of confidence and willing to do the job killed my effort. Maybe I could hold for a few more months but in the end, the company really needed a senior person with far more experience that I had to fix the shit

On one hand, I get it. Not every company is Google and they might not be able to afford a bonus every time an employee does well. However, for the companies that you know can afford it, it feels disheartening.

I'm not one of those workers that works hard for the sake of it. I expect eventual rewards (promotion, raise, bonus, extra vacation days, etc.) for my hard work, and a plate of brownies or a thank you card with a smiling dog on it doesn't cut it; yet now that seems to be the norm.

What happened to working hard and rising through the ranks? How does any company expect their workers to want to produce quality work if they get nothing to show for it? Even just getting a half day off is better than what we are getting.

After consulting reddit and a family member, I learned that some companies ignore the non-solicitation clause in their mutual service agreement, and ""buy out"" an employee working for the other party when they think it's worth it.

I thought that maybe the company wanted to go that road, but I was prudent. I updated my resume and sent it to the recruiter, asking him to make sure to review their service agreement with my employer -- without telling too much.

2 days later: they want to schedule an interview. All right, got it, they want to go down that road. I chose one of the time slot they proposed.

1 day later: the recruiter sent me a short email apologizing. They won't continue the process with me as I was right, they couldn't solicit me. So yeah, he never checked first.

I felt strangely relieved, as I do love my job
despite not being paid to the level of my expertise. I decided to turn this situation to my advantage. I talked to my boss.

I explained what happened without hiding anything. I even told that I was tempted due to the salary. 

She then told me that higher management was already talking about my position, and how I progressed so much since I started 2 years ago to the point where my title and salary don't match what I do. She asked how much they were offering and took note of it. She was surprised they decided to stop the process and even felt sorry for me, but she thanked me for being transparent.

Long story short: i got a promotion last week, a more relevant title, and 30% bump in salary (higher than what was offered by the other company).

300,Tips for Job Interviews,557,dngjbw,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dngjbw/tips_for_job_interviews/,25,"I recently landed a job offer after about a year of on and off job hunting. I went through a ton of phone screens, video interviews, case study assignments and several in-person rounds and these are the notes that I've come up with.

&nbsp;

That being said, I think these tips will be most applicable to early career, non-technical, whitecollar jobs. Most of the companies I applied to used internal recruiters and most of the roles I applied to I'd call ""stretch roles"" based on my background and experience. 

&nbsp;


#Typical Interview Process:

___
&nbsp;

#**1) Application**

The goal here is to get your resume read and to move on to the phone screen phase. Make sure your resume is at least somewhat aligned with the job description/requirements.

&nbsp;

Make it easy to read and make it full of good examples. How did you go above and beyond in your role and by how much? Anybody can follow directions from their manager but how did you go beyond that? How did you crush your goals? How did you take initiative and improve a process? How were you a resource for those around you?

&nbsp;

**TLDR**: Make it easy to read and use accomplishments instead of responsibilities




&nbsp;

___
&nbsp;

#**2) Phone Screen with Recruiter**

This is typically a quick call to make sure both parties are aligned. Share a quick background, career goals, salary expectations, etc.

&nbsp;

Most of this call should be taken care of with preparation. Write out (AND PRACTICE) your elevator pitch. I ended up getting my practice through interviews but it got me flustered and I probably lost out on some opportunities by not being prepared.

&nbsp;

Be ready for the common questions:

&nbsp;


###***“Tell me about yourself/your work history”***

Lead them through your resume but tell them the things that your resume doesn’t say. How did you make your bosses/coworkers’ lives easier? How did you go about taking new responsibilities? How did you become an expert/resource for the people around you? Show that you go above and beyond and that you want to learn.

&nbsp;

###***“What are you looking for in your next role?”***

Use the job description and responsibilities to help answer this (hopefully it actually aligns with what you’re looking for)
Try to give examples or types of work/projects you enjoyed working on in the past and why you liked/disliked them.

Tip: You’re excited about an opportunity to learn.

&nbsp;


###***Be Prepared for Possible Weeding Questions:***

&nbsp;

Does the job require Excel? Be prepared to tell them what your favorite part about excel is (it’s pivot tables).

&nbsp;

Is SQL preferred but not required? Be able to describe the difference between left and right joins.

&nbsp;

Googling “Common _____ Interview Questions” goes a long way

&nbsp;

Drop some keywords that are in the job description and prepare some questions about the role and company. If your career goals are aligned with the company, you meet the basic requirements and you sound excited about the role - you’ll likely move to the next round. 

&nbsp;

**TLDR**: Practice. Align your goals/background with the role. You are excited about the role and want to learn (This is what might get you past being underqualified).

&nbsp;
___
&nbsp;

#**3) Phone/Video Interview with Hiring Manager**

This is a deeper dive into the fit for the role. You’ll likely get some tougher questions to test your knowledge and experience. Learn more about the day-to-day of the role, reiterate your interest and excitement in the role. 

&nbsp;


Use this call to really think about if this role (and manager) would be a good fit for you. See below for more questions you can ask. 

&nbsp;
___
&nbsp;

#**4) In Person Interview with Team**

This is it. The last round. Come in confident that you’ve made it this far and try to frame it as you interviewing them. Be friendly and be someone that you would want to work with/around.

&nbsp;

For onsite interviews, come prepared with specific questions in mind for each person you’ll be speaking with. You can usually ask your recruiter if you should touch on certain topics with certain people you’ll be meeting with. Tailor your questions to each role:

&nbsp;

###***Upper Management:*** 

* Questions around company goals and direction.

* What are some of the goals for this year/quarter and how has progress been?
 
* What excites you the most about getting this role filled?
 
* Do you read business books for self improvement? Do you have any that really stood out to you?

&nbsp;

###***Hiring Manager:*** 

* Questions around how you can make their life easier, expectations and management style.
* What is one area of your jobs you wish you had more time to focus on?
* What are you expecting from me out of this relationship, what type of people do you work best with and how would you describe your management style?
* (If position is backfill) Can you name a time the person in the position really went above and beyond?

&nbsp;

###***Peer:*** 

* Questions about the day to day, work hours, different perspective about your boss
* What are your normal work hours like? Do you ever get to work from home?
* What is your favorite thing about working here?
* If you could change/improve one thing about the job, what would it be?

&nbsp;

###***Member of another team:*** 

* Questions about team structure and how they interact. Also a chance to get a (somewhat) unbiased view of the team/company
* What is an example of when the previous person in the role really went above and beyond for you and your team?

&nbsp;

**IMPORTANT**: When interviewing in person, **try to ask relevant questions throughout the session instead of sending a barrage of questions at the interviewer at the end**. Don’t interrupt them, but take advantage of lulls in the conversation or ask right after you finish answering one of their questions. It makes the experience more conversational and makes you look more interested.

303,My Experience From Job Hunting,555,gt144v,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt144v/my_experience_from_job_hunting/,88,"I have been passively searching for opportunities since December of 2019. This changed to a more active search in late February as my health insurance needs changed. As for some background, I've run my own small business for the past 5 years focused on financial analysis (read heavy in math and statistics) with a strong skill set in programming in excel and R. The reason for my search is I got tired of the bad health insurance I had, and wanted health insurance offered by a large firm.

I wanted to share my experiences and some advice that may benefit those currently in the grind of searching.

**The process of searching:**

1. Dedicate a fair amount of time for searching and applying to jobs. This is going to be a competitive endeavor now with 20 million people recently unemployed. The market has switched from begging you to come to work for us to ""why should we hire you?"".
2. Do not get discouraged if you do not hear back from a company, just move on. Based upon my data from my applications (\~200), the average time that I have heard back from a company interested in speaking to me has been 7 business days. The most common response time (the median) has been within 2 business days. I have had experiences where firms have contacted me 3 months after I applied.
3. Data is king during this process. Create an excel spreadsheet to track your process. This will let you know if you need to make changes to your resume to get through the resume / application screens. At the end, I outlined the data that I've collected and why.
4. I know this is a huge pain in the rear; however, update / customize your resume for every job. Read the job description and take note of words that are used more than once. It is very likely these words are what they will be searching for when they screen your resume and cover letter. I have had more success in getting through the screens after I combined my resume and cover letter together. Page 1 is resume, page 2 is my cover letter. I'm not sure if the resume filters also screen the cover letter, but this method provides more opportunities to get through the screen. Your goal in this step is just to get a human to look at your resume.
5. If you are applying for a position that is outside of your current geographic area, put on your resume a more local city, state and zip code. This will get you past the ""we only want local"" screen. If the application wants a full address, put down the address of a friend, family member, or a nearby apartment complex. If asked about it, explain that during this time I have moved back to be with family and want to find a position nearby to be close to them. This shows them that you already have a move planned and it also alleviates their fear that you will flake on showing up for the job.
6. Build in appropriate expectations for your search.

&#x200B;

* With the high level of unemployment, it is typical that a position will receive 200+ applications. If you get an invitation for a phone interview, this likely means that you were in the top 10 (not 10%) of candidates that applied. From this group, most firms typically will take half to advance to the second round. The second round to third round cuts down to 2 people.
* Be prepared to be ghosted. Out of my \~200 applications, I have had 40 phone interviews. Of these, 20 I have advanced to the next round. Of the 20 I did not make, 5 sent me the thanks but no thanks e-mail. Even if the phone interviewer seems impressed with you and talks about next steps and advancing you and what that process looks like, do not get too excited or attached to the position until the actual invite for the next round comes to you.

**Recruiters:**

I have have had the privilege to interact with all-star recruiters and the absolute worst of the bunch. The best recruiters are going to typically come from small, sub-specialized firms that only focus on a particular niche. You will absolutely know it when you talk to them. They are going to want to know why are you looking, what type of team / company you are looking to join, and will offer great assistance during the interview process. The all-star recruiters will not pressure you to sign a right to represent form.  They will typically spend 45 minutes to an hour talking with you.

Now for the dregs of the recruiting community. If a recruiter calls you and you can hear a lot of noise in the background, they are calling you from a phone farm. They make their money by volume and throwing as many resumes at a position as possible to secure their commission. They will often pressure you to sign a right to represent form (NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER sign these). By signing this form you are agreeing to let them represent you in the process of applying to firm. This can cause huge problems for you if you end up or have already applied to the firm. The recruiting firm will take the stance that they are owed a commission from the company, and it is easier for a company to pass on you so that they do not have to deal with this conflict.

These are the typical signs of a horrible recruiter:

* Lots of noise in the background
* Very brief conversation (less than 5 minutes) before asking if they can submit you to a position
* Pressure to sign a right to represent form
* They ask you to change the titles on your resume
   * never do this, if a company calls to check your employment history they will discover this
   * when companies check employment, they call your previous firm and ask for dates of employment and titles. This is all that HR can give out
* They ask you to add responsibilities that you did not have in previous roles on your resume
   * again, very easy to verify by pulling up job description from an old job posting of your prior role
* **They ask for your date of birth or social security number** (there is absolutely zero reason they need this information; NEVER GIVE THEM THIS INFORMATION)

There are what I would refer to as middle tier recruiters at very large job recruiters. I have had mixed experiences with them. Some of them are good, some not so good. I would at least listen to what they have to say.

**Interviews:**

A huge advantage during this unfortunate time is that most interviews are being done by telephone or a video meeting. This allows you to have up on your computer screen a script to answer the most common questions; however, in writing your script make sure to add in pauses and breaks to make it appear as if you are coming up with it off the top of your head. This is important since you are likely to be repeating these answers multiple times throughout the interview process with different companies and in various rounds with the same company. Being consistent with your answers within a company is important, they will compare notes between rounds and note discrepancies.

Do your research on the person(s) you will be talking to? Pull up their LinkedIn account and see if you have any common background (school, previous employer) or if they have something unique such as helping a local charity or other volunteer service. This is a great rapport builder.

**The initial phone screen:**

The initial phone screen breaks down into two parts: HR person telling you the salary range and benefits and basic questions about your qualifications.

In the initial phone screen, they will go over salary requirements, hours, benefits etc. Most HR people have stopped asking ""how much you currently make"" since this question is illegal in California, Illinois, and several other states. They will typically ask what salary range you are targeting. DO NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION DIRECTLY, you can rule yourself out immediately with an answer that is too high or too low.

Instead phrase it as: A recruiting firm that I was speaking with provided me market data for the title and seniority level and it is an extremely wide range from a low of (name something that is 20% lower than whats on the low end of the Glassdoor salary range to 20% higher than the high end). I'm not trying to play games or waste anybody's time, but its hard to tell what a fair salary is without diving deeper into the specific responsibilities. What is your targeted range for the position? I have never had any problems with this response. I have always received a salary range from the HR person.

**THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS SAY YES THIS IS IN LINE WITH MY EXPECTATIONS or I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THAT RANGE.**

>Even if the salary range is below what you are looking for or well below the market rate, still tell them YES.  The reason you do this is so that you can keep advancing through the interview process to get more practice in a live situation.  Repetition is going to help make you more comfortable in interviews, provide an opportunity to practice your answers, and most importantly gain exposure to different questions and interview styles (strict question answer format versus dialogue based).  This will help you for future interviews for positions that you really want.  Do not turn down any opportunities to learn, practice, and get more comfortable with the process.

The initial phone screen is preliminary test to see if you check the right boxes. They are looking to verify that you have the skills / experience listed on the resume match up with the requirements of the job. Be prepared to match at least one experience with every listed job requirement and preferred experience.

Also be prepared to answer the following questions:

* **Tell me about yourself** \[this is typically the very first question that you will be asked\]

This is the MOST important question of the initial phone interview!

Remember, this is your chance to brag about how great you are and how you would be an excellent fit for the job. Keep in mind that you were likely 10 people they selected to speak too.

Write out a narrative to have in front of you to act as guide. Don't just go into robot zombie mode reading it. Also customize it to match up with the specific job. Most jobs have a wide range of responsibilities from doing individual work to collaborative work. If the job posting mentions working with teams or interacting with senior management, highlight this aspect in your previous roles.

* **What attracted you to our company?**
* **What attracted you to this role?**

These are the three most important questions to nail. Do your research on the company website, LinkedIn, and twitter account. I have had great success when I have pointed out that I am attracted to the companies charitable side and have mentioned a specific charity that they supported or allow for volunteer days. For the specific role, I have highlighted how this was similar to a previous role or part of what I did in a previous role that I really enjoyed. For each of these, I have typically four or five bullet points written down to touch upon.

* Name three of your strengths
   * make sure that these match up with the job description
* Name three of your weakness
   * do not pull the strengths as weakness answers - ""I try too hard, I care too much""
   * Instead answer with realistic problems that you have, and HOW YOU MANAGE THEM!
      * For example, I answer this questions as follows:

Three of my greatest weaknesses are paralysis by analysis, frustrations when projects / work runs behind, and co-workers that are not putting forth an adequate level of effort. In focusing on wanting to make sure that I'm not paralyzed or taking too long on an analytical project, I seek feedback from colleagues on the completeness and scope of projects. I have had instances were I went beyond the scope of the task since I kept searching out more data. On my frustrations with the pace of projects and work being done, I make myself step back and take a 30,000 foot look to see how this could be impacting several different groups / divisions and to gain perspective that these decisions need to be thoroughly thought through to take the best action for the firm. In terms of co-workers that I don't feel are doing there best, I also take a step back and look at the totality of their work beyond what is impacting me directly. I am more mindful that they might have a lot on their plate, or possibly waiting on someone else. So I have taken a proactive approach to this to see how I may help them.

Make sure to have questions to ask the HR person interviewing you at the end. Even better if you can fit them into a conversation. More on Questions later.

My experience with the initial HR phone screens have varied widely based upon the experience of the person. My typical experience with a less tenured or fresh out of school HR person is that they are just going down a checklist to see if they can check the boxes with NO AUTHORITY to deviate what constitutes checking the box.

>Jr HR: Do you have experience with ABC Technology platform?  
>  
>Me: No, but I do have extensive experience with their competitors platform XYZ that is very similar to ABC.  
>  
>Jr HR: So, do you have experience with ABC tech platform?

If you experience this, just keep trying to let them know you have the skills. Although, you are likely not going to advance beyond the ""can I check the box?"" HR person. Keep giving it your best, but forget about the interview after its done and set your expectations accordingly.

My experience with tenured, seasoned HR recruiters has been extremely positive. They know you made the initial cut, and really want to get down into your skills and abilities even if they are on different systems or platforms than what their company utilizes.

>Sr HR: Do you have experience with ABC Technology platform?  
>  
>Me: No, but I do have extensive experience with their competitors platform XYZ.  
>  
>Sr HR: Oh that's great. They are pretty similar, you'll be able to pick it up quickly.

**1st Round Interview:**

Expect a repeat of the first round questions:

* Tell me about yourself
* What attracted you to our company?
* What attracted you to this role?

Depending upon the type of job, this round typically focuses on evaluating your technical ability to do the job. Be prepared to talk about examples of work that you have done that matches up with each bullet point of their requirements. Also be prepared to answer questions about the industry or field that the role is in.

Also in this round, be prepared for behavioral interview questions (the tell me a time . . . ). These typically follow a predictable theme. The typical format for answering these is S.T.A.R.

S/T = Situation or Task

A = what actions you took

R = result

Most people, nail the first two parts but trail off on the result. The result is the important part. Again, with interviews being done remotely, write these up in bullet point format and have up on your screen or written down to refer to when asked a question.

Expect to see questions on: Tell me a time when you . . .

* had a tight deadline or time crunch having to complete a task / project
* had difficulty with a co-worker
* had difficult / tough feedback from a manager
* had a difficult client interaction
* had to persuade someone
* had to teach a new skill to someone
* had a successful (or failed) project what did you do (or learn)

**2nd Round Interview:**

This is typically a fit interview. Do you fit in with the culture? Expect to be asked more behavioral questions. Also be prepared to talk about what motivates you, and what you want to achieve in this role.

This is quite often when you will be asked about ""Where do you see yourself in five years?"" You might get this question on the first phone interview, or even in the 1st round. So have this prepared from the get-go.

If you are asked this question in a 2nd or 3rd round interview, your answer better well involve being at the company. So here is the answer that I have provided in later rounds:

With great deference to the unpredictability of time and evolution and with a great deal of arrogance, I see myself working at XYZ company doing what needs to be done. In the short-term, I would be focused on beginning the process of mastering the role that we are talking about today. That is going to involve learning XYZ companies policies, procedures, technology, and general workflows as well as forming meaningful relationships with peers inside our group as well as those in other departments. In the intermediate term, I would be focused on deepening my expertise \[in something that you are really good at\], and continuing my development \[in something that you are weak in or just learning\] while also maintaining an open, adaptable mindset to learn new technologies, processes, or whatever is necessary to be of value in the future. If I continually focus on improving myself, adapting to the changing working environment, and building, developing meaningful relationships, I will be of tremendous value to the company as well as the flexibility to fit into ever evolving roles and increasing responsibility.

The basic premise of the where do you see yourself in fives years is to evaluate if you have a plan on self-improvement and how do you see yourself fitting in and continuously adding value to an organization.

**3rd/4th/5th Rounds**:

If there are interviews beyond the second round and they are with peers you would be possibly working with, they are measuring your ability to fit in and likability. These typically do not involve technical questions, but be prepared just in case. These are usually informal chats; however, you CANNOT treat them as informal. You are still be evaluated on if the person would want to spend 8 hours a day working with you. My advice is to find something in common off of their LinkedIn to ask them about. Throw in a couple of easy questions for them:

* Walk me through a typical day?
* What led you to XYZ company? Talk to me about your journey up the ranks at XYZ?
* What does it take to be successful in this role?

**Final Round:**

Congratulations, you have made it to the final two or three people out of possible 500 that applied for the job.

You will typically be interviewing with an extremely senior person. HR or the recruiter will tell you that this is your final round.

These interviews are typically very conversational, where the TOP DOG is trying to determine your motivations and how you will fit in with the team and the overall company. Keep in mind he/she has been told good things about you, otherwise you would not be speaking with them. Even though it is likely to be informal, still come prepared for the standard questions. Also come prepared to talk about what you learned from speaking with previous people. A common question that is asked is: tell me what you think our biggest problem is and tell me how you would help?

The follow-up questions that I've asked in the final rounds and have received a wow response are:

* Where do you see the company in five years?
* What makes a person successful at company xyz?

When its done reflect on your performance. If there is something that you did not explain well enough or come across clearly, utilize the thank you note to the HR person that has been setting up the interviews to expand upon your short-coming in the interview.

For example,

Dear HR Person,

I want to thank you for considering me for xyz position. I greatly appreciate the time and effort that you and \[list everyone's name that you spoke with\] have taken during the interview process. After spending the time talking with you and your team about this role, the \[insert name of position\] is even more appealing the more I learned about it. Specifically, \[name something cool about the role that you really like\]. Most importantly, I can really see myself working alongside \[names of peers that you have spoken with\]

After reflecting on my interview with THE BIG CHEESE, I realized that I might not have clearly explained abcdefg. I want to make sure that he/she knows that \[what you want to clarify or expound upon\]

If you or your team have any questions, please feel welcomed to reach out to me. I would be more than happy to answer them.

Thank you,

Your Name

**Questions:**

It is extremely important to ask questions during the process. It indicates that you are genuinely interest in the role and finding more about the company than is available on the website.

**The most important question to ask when they ask if you have any questions is to lead with:**

>Do you have any questions or reservations about skills or abilities so that I may have an opportunity to address them?

If they answer no, this is a positive sign. If they respond that they do, this provides you a second chance to highlight that you have the ability, skills or experience to do the job.

* For the initial phone screen:
   * What is the most important aspect of this role? (this will provide you another chance to highlight how you are a fit)
   * What led you to join XYZ company? or What has kept you at XYZ company (if they are tenured).
   * What is one thing that surprised you about working at XYZ company that you didn't know before walking in on your 1st day? (this will let them talk and provide you more information to utilize in the next round of interviews)
* For 1st & 2nd Round (These are typically with a manager of the group you are looking to join):
   * What makes someone successful in this role? (another chance to show how you would be a good fit with a follow-up response)
   * What is a your biggest challenge or point of pain that you are facing? (another place to step in with your previous experience)
   * What led you to XYZ company? What has kept you at XYZ company?
   * What does a typical day look like?

**Job Tracking Excel Sheet:**

* Column A: Company Name
* Column B: Job Title
* Column C: Job ID #
   * This will help avoiding to double apply through a recruiter and directly through the company's website
* Column D: Downloaded Job Description (Yes or No)
   * Make sure to download the description or print and save as a PDF. This will help if the company removes the job posting from their website or LinkedIn. This will also help avoid applying through a recruiter and the company directly
* Column E: username (for online application)
* Column F: Password
   * some companies websites are a mess to get a reset password, especially for government jobs
* Column G: Date Applied (type in date of application)
* Column H: Days Since Application
   * =IF(ISBLANK(G2),"""",ABS(TODAY()-G2))
* Column I: Phone Interview (Yes or No)
* Column J: Date of Initial Phone Screen
* Column K: Days Since Phone Screen
   * =IF(ISBLANK(J2),"""",IF(TODAY()-J2<0,"""",TODAY()-J2))
* Column L: Advanced to 1st Round (Yes or No)
* Column N: Days Since 1st Round
   * =IF(ISBLANK(M2),"""",IF(TODAY()-M2<0,"""",TODAY()-M2))

By tracking the data, it will give a picture of what is working and what is not. If you are getting to a lot of phone screens but not advancing onwards, the approach to the phone screen is not working. Same for 1st round.

Keep your head up, keep searching, and try your best not to get down on yourself. If you do get down, get up from your computer and go for a walk to relax. The deleterious effects of a job search on mental health can be tremendous, even more so during this time. To help offset these effects, the medical science is very clear on this: exercise (brisk walks count), eating as healthy as possible, and getting at least 15 to 20 minutes of sunshine.",1590814486.0,2020-05-30 00:54:46

Edit 2: Just concluded my interview, however like many suggested in the comments and I was weary of my self, the job that I think they will offer  me (my interviews were great and both interviewers liked what I had to say) is not the same job as the one I applied for. About a quarter of a way into the interview I was able to figure out that this is actually just a front line sales position and that if I wanted the actual job I had applied for I’d have to start with front line sales. Not what I’m looking for even remotely and not even remotely close to the job I applied for. It sucks but it happens especially in marketing let it be a warning to anyone looking at similar positions. Onward we go with the job hunt though.

306,I got a job out of state thanks in part to this subreddit!,547,ay7muq,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ay7muq/i_got_a_job_out_of_state_thanks_in_part_to_this/,78,"Lurker here! I currently work in the Midwest at a college as a support staff, I make under $30k a year and my partner and I want to move to Chicago to start a new life. I graduated with a bachelor's of social work in 2018 and I'm transitioning into financial services. 

I used /u/SheetsGiggles's [guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7y8k6p/im_an_exrecruiter_for_some_of_the_top_companies/) as a resume template, and some advice from others here saying to highlight my relevant experience at the top of the resume as an easily digestible summary. [Here is a copy of my resume with some redactions.](https://imgur.com/a/8RYNzK6)

What I've learned as somebody transitioning from an unrelated field to a new one:

- Troll LinkedIn, Glassdoor and ZipRecruiter every day for new positions. LinkedIn especially. Also, brush up your LinkedIn and take a professional LinkedIn photo at JCPenneys for $30 from GroupOn, it really helps.

- [Keep track of every job application in a Google Sheets/Excel document](https://imgur.com/a/2cMc218), along with last dates of contact. Call back or email 2 weeks later to inquire on candidate selection process if you are still interested.

- Try to do definable things that are explicitly related to the field you are trying to get into, and things that are a little harder to do that show your commitment to the field. You can put these up top. An example may be that you volunteer to teach classes at X doing Y.

- Change your location on your resume to ""Relocating to X location on Y date."" I started getting more positive responses when I did this. On job applications where you have to annoyingly put all your information into the job application again, I used 'To Be Determined' for street address, and a city that is near to the job location.

- Write a good cover letter! I sent a cover letter with every job application. I used a template that I modified based on the job type. I applied to two different types of jobs: financial services jobs (mainly client support positions on advisor teams) and financial aid jobs. I had cover letters for both types. I also addressed possible barriers including why I wanted to relocate to Chicagoland and that I would be willing to pay for my relocation. I sent both my resume and cover letter in PDF to keep the formatting.

- When you get interviews, do your research to show that you are interested in the company and use the STAR method. This one is a classic recommendation but I found it helped.

- Do an in-person interview if you can swing it. This position I have just accepted I drove 7 hours one way after work, stayed at a hotel for a night, drove to the interview at 9am, went to a second interview at another opportunity (I called them after I got an in person interview scheduled asking for one since I would be in town that day), and then drove back 7 hours. The people I interviewed with seemed impressed that I was that committed. I let it be known that I drove to the interview from where I live casually as we were exchanging pleasantries while walking to the interview.

It took only two months of searching and 25 job applications this time because I was more methodical in my applications than I was last time thanks to this subreddit. It's also a 53% nominal pay raise, 26% considering cost of living, and it's in my chosen field!

307,Got 3 offers at once after 10 months of job hunting in 3 different countries!!!,550,jornzi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jornzi/got_3_offers_at_once_after_10_months_of_job/,70,"So,I won't go into too much detail(you can check my previous posts) but I received 3 job offers at once from 3 different countries after almost 1200+ applications. I have been applying since January and  honestly I was starting to loose hope but I still kept on applying and going through the motions as it had become a habit( like everyone here says -""looking for a job is a job itself"").I got two mid level positions in Germany and Czechia and a senior level post in Italy( I am based in Italy),while also being in the final round for 3 more companies from the Netherlands and Switzerland.The past 3 weeks had been overwhelming given the numbers of interviews I was giving( not complaining as I am still grateful) The funny thing is I am just a fresh graduate and my was selected solely on my abilities for higher positions. 
I want to thank each and everyone in this community that has helped me ,kept me motivated and given me valuable advice I truly needed .Seeing everyone here just helping each other out and sharing their feelings is heartwarming .I will continue to help everyone here in the years to come  ,to the best of my abilities.

I have some points or advice I want to share which were helpful to me and some which I have learned in my journey.


1. Just Apply ! Don't look at the requirements on how many years are required ,if you feel like you can do the work-most probably you are qualified.

2. During technical rounds if there are tasks or take home assignments ,always over deliver and practice your answers for all possible questions to justify your solution.If you nail this you are probably going to get the job.

3.It is a numbers game . pretty obvious but it is true.Do remember to research the company and and make personalized cover letters.I had made a template for myself and changed certain details plus added minor changes based on each company I was applying to.

4.Networking definitely helps but I will give an introverts perspective.I tried my best but for me it is very hard and there are no clear ways on how to network.What I can recommend is thank you emails to the HR and people who have interviewd you.This goes a long way.

5.Patience definitely is a must.The first offer I received was after 1.5 months of no replies and ghosted follow up emails.

6.Take time off from applying but during the time off,make sure to get better at what you do so the demoralizing job search process doesn't take away the passion from what you love doing.

7.Personal projects are considered if they are good enough(Being a fresh graduate that's how I showed experience)

8.CV is very important-I can give more detailed info on this if you want,but in short I went from getting no interviews to atleast 20 interviews in a month just my fixing my CV.Trying and experimenting from what I had learned from all the rejections.

9.Lastly hope.I know it is easy to say this now and it sounds cliche ,but coming from the same place off over ,1000 + rejections ,being totally demotivated, hopeless and miserable.There is a light at the end of the tunnel.Times are difficult especially due to COVID-19 and for fresh graduates with the paradox of work and experience but just keep going at it for everything else I know I and this beautiful community is here to help you and each other .

TLDR-Finally found 3 jobs offers and multiple interviews after 10 months and 1100+ applications",1604640966.0,2020-11-06 00:36:06
308,(Update) I got rejected because of my reference's answers,550,jaboph,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/jaboph/update_i_got_rejected_because_of_my_references/,171,"I just don't know where to share this news. I went here a few days ago to ask if it's normal to tell your coworkers your personal problems. Since my supervisor just told the company I applied to that I don't trust my coworkers. I was the one that provided an explanation to the HR because he didn't specify why his response was like that. That he's just encouraging me to open up to my coworkers by sharing my problems.

Today the company contacted me to say that they don't want to continue with my application because of my reference's response. So I messaged my supervisor to ask him about his answers. If there's something wrong with my performance at work or if he mentioned the things that we talked about during coaching sessions. He tried to downplay it by saying that he only mentioned about me being a ""silent worker"" and he never said anything about trust. I said that I already told them I am quiet while working and it's not enough reason for the HR to call me back and ask if I have issues with my coworkers and with the supervisor.

I also told him that if he thinks my personal issues are the sole reason why the quality of my work is affected then it means he didn't really consider our concerns in regards with the unrealistic demands of the management. We're pretty vocal with our troubles and suggestions when it comes to work. Still, nothing happens.

He still insists I tell my coworkers my personal issues. I just told him what the kind redditor commented on my previous post said: it's a place of work not a therapy. 

I'm not even angry I got rejected. I'm furious that I worked my ass off, he complimented my work ethics while I was there, and then at that reference check it's like all he could remember was me refusing to tell everyone what's bothering me at home.

I didn't care if I was disrespectful, he's not even working in that company anymore. He was forced to resign because the performance of the whole project     became poor and the employees are quitting left and right. It shows that there's something wrong with the management.

So, I'll edit my resume again to remove him from my character reference and continue to apply to other companies. Thanks for reading my rant!!",1602618096.0,2020-10-13 15:41:36

310,"Went from unemployed for a year, to minimum wage, to getting an offer in my dream city with my highest salary ever",546,8lv0k3,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8lv0k3/went_from_unemployed_for_a_year_to_minimum_wage/,52,"I know it's tough out there, I've lived it and read it all over this subreddit. Hopefully this will help inspire a few of you not to give up.

In 2014, I was stressed out and ready to just move out of my small town and to my dream city. When I told my manager I was going to resign and why, they gave me 3 options: 

1. Work remotely as a contractor for a while or as needed
2. Work remotely until I find another job
3. Stay on full time with full benefits working remotely in my dream city

I was making $80K/year before bonuses and had been there almost a decade so obviously I chose number 3. Had a meeting with the president of the company and was told they expected me to commit to this remote position ""for at least a year."" Only caveat was that there would be a review after 3 months to make sure everything was working for both parties. I didn't care. I trusted them and I knew I wasn't changing my mind. If that's the peace of mind they needed, so be it.

3 months later, my manager gave me the heads up that I my position might be cut due to budgeting. Of course, nothing about budgeting was mentioned when I spoke my manager, HR, or the president before I sold my car, got an expensive lease, and bought all new furniture. I was laid off on New Year's day 2015 but, hey, at least I knew it was coming. It was a company I had been with for nearly 10 years, had a good relationship with my manager, the team I managed, my kid even had play dates with the owners' kid more than once.

After getting laid off on New Years, I built an app, got my LLC license, made business cards and fliers and did everything I could but when my lease was up that summer, I headed back to my hometown defeated, car\-less, job\-less and living on my parents' couch. A couple months into moving back I had an injury that had me bedridden for 3 months with, of course, no health insurance. It felt like a horror movie.

I was unemployed for most of 2015. That December, I got a job working on a website for a friend for about 9 months. When that ended, I sucked it up and applied for a job making $7/hr. It was at that point I cut out drinking. I don't consider myself an alcoholic by any meanse but the way I saw it, if being sober gave me an even 1&#37; chance of turning things around then that's what I was going to do. 

6 months later I applied for and got another job in my field locally making $60K which was amazing considering albeit in a much more junior role than before.

About 2 weeks ago I deleted my Monster and Career Builder accounts, they were useless \(kept LinkedIn although that one's useless too\) and getting spammed with low\-ball offers in the Midwest wasn't doing anything for my morale. It wasn't long afterwards I got a call about something I applied to, probably through [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com) , in my dream city. 2 interviews later and they made me an offer for 90K. I nearly cried. I am leaving in 2 days and start next week. It's been 3 and 1/2 years since I was laid off and almost exactly 3 years since I moved back home.

I know it's tough out there, I know it feels impossible, I've been there. My only advice is, keep trying. If you're not getting what you want, find a personal project you can work on alone and eventually monetize \(a website, an app, whatever\). Or write a up a business plan \(which is what I was working on before the offer\). Just do something to keep yourself moving forward. Surround yourself with a positive support group of friends and family. The jobs I applied for that gave me the best responses were on [Indeed.com](https://Indeed.com) . I only applied to jobs that were 1 \- 4 days old and only ones with the salaries posted. Hope this helps at least 1 person.

**TL;DR: Was making $80K, got laid off after moving to my dream city, unemployed nearly all of 2015, worked for a friend for 9 months, then for minimum wage for 6 months. Got a job making $90K in my dream city after 3 long years.**",1527215839.0,2018-05-24 22:37:19

I was at times pumping 5 or 6 out per day. I got one interview out of all of them, which went terribly.

A few weeks later I decided to try something new. I applied to two jobs a week only. With each job, I'd take about three or four hours to research the company. I would write a completely original cover letter, tailoring it to the job description. If the job description was casual and quirky, I'd be casual and quirky. If it was serious, I'd be serious. I would include *all* of the key words I saw in the description (research, writing ability, juggling multiple projects, etc) with specific examples. Then after I submit it, I looked on LinkedIn to see what 2nd and 3rd degree connections I had with that company, and if any alumni of my college work there, and email them for an informational interview. For all but the tiniest companies I was able to find at least one person to interview, and they all agreed to speak with me.

After around three weeks of doing that, I have **six** interviews this week, all for companies and positions I'm really excited about. 5 out of 7 of the companies I applied to using my new method called me for an interview; another one is from a recruiter who found me through one of the people I had an informational interview with. I also feel more ready for my interview because of all my research.

It wasn’t even for that good of a job but the company itself seemed like a good place to work at and it would have made me move to another country where I really wanted to work, but apparently, feeling at ease during an interview (because your interlocutors put you in this state of trust) is seen  as something bad. 

Like how are you supposed to act if your interlocutors themselves act relaxed? And still, I’m young and am sociable, I’m not gonna act like a grave! I have plenty of enthusiasm and am motivated, what else do they want? This is  mentally exhausting, I feel like I can’t even apply anymore, I’ve been doing that for around 3 months now with little to no result except for that company. And that’s a position I really wanted for that reason.

Back to 0. 5 interviews, jesus. I’ll be sure not to waste that much time for a company in the future, especially for entry jobs. That’s just ridiculous.

And of course, as we always say, don’t stop applying just because you’re moving forward with a company. 
Just wanted to vent, sorry. Hope you guys have better luck.

This past year has been the toughest of my life and I have faced rejections from over 200 companies, the majority of which never even had the decency to get back to me. As I sent off my 300th job application, I wondered how long it would be before I was employed. As I was thinking that exact thought, a leading multinational company got back to me and offered me a job I had interviewed for.

The job search is brutal - companies are really shitty and it takes a lot to keep pushing through the rejections. My advice as someone who has finally made it through it all is to KEEP GOING. Your break is coming. Out of 300 job applications, one company saw something in me. If it’s attainable (which it is), it’s all a matter of time and effort to make it happen so keep going.

Just by dumb luck, the national conference for my desired career area was in the town I just moved to, so I took the risk and financial hit to attend hoping to make some local connections. Leading up to the first days I had major anxiety about going and really wanted to back out.

I hit a major hiccup at the career fair when I realized that none of the jobs were local. After a quick panic I regrouped and poured through the conference schedule to attend any session possible where the presenter was from a local institution. I sat in the front, participated in activities, and after every session walked up the presenter and introduced myself. With dumb luck, one of the presenters knew about my previous job and wanted to connect over lunch. Then, she introduced me to some of her coworkers that were hiring as well as the executive director.

Now, I'm set to tour their offices this week and the presenter has already looked at some of my online portfolio and wants to talk about what she's seen. My former supervisor (who was also at the conference) sent me a message and let me know the the presenter has already reached out about me.

318,"I got a job today!!! After making hundreds of applications, I learned these tips",531,ke03o4,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ke03o4/i_got_a_job_today_after_making_hundreds_of/,59,"I've seen lots of posts like this on here so I thought I'd make one.

The job is fulltime with benefits. It's a receptionist job. I filled out applications for so long...on most of them I never got a call back. But I slowly learned to do these things to start getting responses:

1. Use a resume service. I used a free trial from a professional resume making site (I forget the name, but if you type in Google ""professional resume maker"" you should find plenty of sites). The site was awesome because it had thousands of prewritten phrases and made my resume look perfect.

2. Do the assessments. I used Indeed for all my job applications. I did a lot of the assessments they offered (the tests pop up automatically whenever you apply for a job), and the employers get to see how you scored. I think this really helped my resume to stick out.

3. I was hired from only doing a phone interview due to the pandemic. But I recommend telling them you can work any shift (as long as you're really available) and that you practice the interview questions beforehand. 

4. You don't have to lie on your resume. People told me to list fake jobs or to lie about my skills, but it's really easy for employers to catch you. They can get your real employment history just from having your SSN. Edit: I put the wrong term!! I meant that they can check your employment history, with the *background check*. A lot of people think there's only one type of background check and that it only checks your criminal history, but there are also employment background checks too.

5. I only applied to jobs on Indeed that were a max of 3 days old. If you apply to jobs that have been there for longer, there's probably going to be too many applicants and no one will even see your application. Edit: It's true that lots of companies will leave jobs up for longer and will still be looking to hire new people. But Indeed would notify me that 80+ people had applied for the older jobs, and they implied that there were too many people applying for my application to be noticed.

6. (Edit) If you're really worried about an employment gap...well, say the unemployment rate is 3% (I'm only guessing because I know many people debate the percentage due to the pandemic). Since 97% of people are employed, that means that you're only competing with the remaining 3%. You don't need to have a perfect resume because you're not competing against that many people...

7. (Edit) If you really want some more employment history, then I'd say you should put some form of self employment on your resume. Babysitting, petsitting, yard work, freelancing, just anything you want. You can say that you didn't make enough money to have to file self employment taxes (so that's why you don't have any proof of income) or that you worked in exchange for free rent or food...but actually fabricating employment dates or where you worked, can be caught by employers fairly easily. If you have to lie a little, then lie about something they can't prove.",1608113716.0,2020-12-16 05:15:16

I would say that, objectively, I love my actual job.  And I have very strong relationships with 95% of my coworkers.  Over the past year or so, I am trying to come to terms with the fact that, despite those positive things, my workplace's managers are so toxic and inefficient that I need to leave.  I have witnessed this management run off countless amazing employees over the years.  I was trying to make it work.  But I feel close to severe burnout after we became essential during this pandemic and those managers not only put us into danger, but also became increasingly absent when we needed them the most.  My coworkers and I are severely exhausted and struggling, and nobody in our chain of command is sympathetic.  I recently landed a new job that is a good opportunity, but it isn't in the emergency field (which I love) and it is at a smaller business.  For whatever reason I am really struggling to let go of my old job. Without going into too many details, I am just looking for some advice/support.

Has anyone else had to leave a job they cared about deeply, that they felt forced to leave for their own mental and physical health?  How did you cope with the feeling of loss about this?  I keep second guessing myself and thinking ""maybe it wasn't so bad"".  Thank you for any thoughts.

Unfortunately, there are currently many unemployed in this country due to the covid. I've been trying to find a new job for 3 months. I sent dozens of applications. I was only invited to three interviews. With two, I felt like I could have done something better. But the third interview arrived. 

It included an assignment and later an interview. I put everything and all my free time to do mybest. Interview was excellent. But next day they didn't accept me. Not gonna lie i had little mental breakdown. Anyway in rejection email it was stated, that I could call and find out the reason why. So today i called.  I dictated the name and woman from HR starts a more or less word into the words I quote: ""Well, you know, I don't want to lie to you, you had the best assignment done best of all candidates, the best presented at the interview i had.  your interview was the best . The reason we preferred the candidate is that  unfortunately your future colleague who was present at the interview decided that you are not  not sympathetic to her. Her team are mostly woman, so she prefered women. Even though we thought you were the best candidate, they just outvoted us. Do you have a question? "" 

So I tell her no, but I'd rather hear that someone was just better than me, not that the reason is that someone dont like how i look or i dont why. Then HR told me  she didn't want to lie to me, that it was embarrassing also for her, and I could hear it enough from her voice too.

328,My speech impediment is severely affecting my career and I don't know what to do about it.,524,bz2jtn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bz2jtn/my_speech_impediment_is_severely_affecting_my/,178," I have a severe stutter. Basically I’m non-verbal. I have to do all my communicating at my job via email. It’s just impossible for me to talk to anyone. I communicate with my wife and family via ASL. Nobody at my employer knows ASL.

&#x200B;

In college I majored in accounting. Been a CPA for 27 years now, same company for 24. I also have an MBA. It’s a large company on the west coast. On my annual performance reviews I get really high marks, the company is very satisfied with my work. They consistently rate me well above average. What’s killing me is the communication section of the reviews. I get very low marks there because I can’t verbally communicate with anybody. As a result I make about $46,000 a year. A CPA at my experience level should get 3 times that. Maybe more. My speech impediment has seriously limited my career growth. I can’t even remember the last time I got an appreciable pay raise.

&#x200B;

I’ve applied to other companies and had interest. I can usually score an interview if they contact me via email, which is where things fall apart. I never get a call back after the interview disaster. In the interviews the hiring managers eyes glaze over as I write my answers on a legal pad. The interview is quickly ended and I am shown the door. “We’ll call you.” They never do.

&#x200B;

If a prospective employer calls me it’s a complete non-starter. I use a transcription service. You call my number and an operator answers, who then transcribes the phone call on an app. Reading my responses back to the caller. Once an employer sees that they say they need to call me back to schedule the interview. They never call back.

&#x200B;

Over the years I’ve spent tens of thousands of dollars on speech therapy with no improvement. I’ve tried every kind of treatment there is. Nothing helps, this is just the way I am.

&#x200B;

Am I just stuck where I’m at? My wife is a service writer at a Honda dealership, never went to college, and makes more than I do. It’s a little embarrassing. I love her to death, and I feel inadequate that I can’t provide her with the things she wants. She really wants a house with a large yard so she can garden. If I could make what I’m supposed to be making, this wouldn’t be a problem.

&#x200B;

In theory disability laws are supposed to protect people like me. The reality is if I took my employer to court that would be a fantastic way to get blackballed in the industry and never work again. Not that I could afford to take a billion dollar company to court anyway.

&#x200B;

What the company is doing to me might very well be illegal. So what? Best case scenario, the company gets investigated, they pay a fine, then when all the commotion dies down I’m quietly let go. Then what? File a wrongful termination lawsuit? With what money?

&#x200B;

I thought maybe the local newspaper would do a story about me. It might shame the company into bumping my pay. Then six months later, when nobody cares anymore, I’d get downsized.

&#x200B;

Do I have any options? Preferably options that won’t set off a nuke in my career. I’ve thought about sending an email to Human Resources, but they’re there to protect the company from me. If I rock the boat I could find myself downsized pretty damn quick.

&#x200B;

I need some outside perspective, from where I’m sitting it looks like I’m completely stuck. I had my annual performance review on Friday. Boss had nothing but good things to say about the quality of work that I do. Yet, because of my “poor communication skills” this is another year I won’t be getting a raise.

&#x200B;

27 years of experience and I’m making what somebody who graduated college yesterday would make. I know money isn’t everything, but it’s humiliating. Guys half my age are making more than twice what I am. It makes me feel like less of a man. Nobody wants to hire an employee who can’t speak. A non-verbal employee can’t lead a team, can’t direct a meeting, can’t make a telephone call, can’t have a conversation unless he writes it down or you know ASL. Excuse my language, but it fucking sucks. I’ve flown to the other side of the country for interviews to try and get a better paying job. When there’s dozens of qualified applicants, the employer isn’t going to pick the non-verbal candidate.

&#x200B;

To be blunt, my employer is taking advantage of me because they know the deck is severely stacked against me finding another job. I hate to seem ungrateful, but I think I should be making closer to the salary someone in my career and experience level would make. Having a non-verbal employee is a detriment to an employer and I understand I should make a little less because of it. This level of pay just feels ridiculous to me. Can you understand how bad I feel having to tell my wife that it’s another year without a pay raise? She’s a saint and doesn’t show it, but I know she’s disappointed. It hurts. It really hurts.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I just don’t know what to do. My wife is on twoxchromosomes all the time and suggested I ask here to see if you guys can come up with some ideas for me.",1560225721.0,2019-06-11 00:02:01

I have been looking for a job since February and it has been extremely hard on my own morale and the closest people around me. It is, hands down, the hardest thing I've ever done. I have always had passion for IT. After graduated from a good public university and failing to secure a job right after, I took some non-IT, sales position, which I ended up hating. Further along, I had  more spotty experience with sales and project management in a non-IT related fields. After the last one ended, I was determined to go back into IT in a help desk/tech support kind of role. Thankfully, I live in what is probably the 2nd Silicon Valley in the U.S., so tech companies are plentiful. I never imagined, however, that it will take me 8 months! After applying to hundreds of places and basically begging to be hired, I kept running into a wall. I couldn't even get into Tier 1 tech support. Well, a couple of weeks ago I interviewed at a huge Fortune 500 company, got along with the hiring manager really well and was finally offered a position in a Tier 2 Tech Support role with plenty of opportunity for growth. Needless to say, it was an emotional moment. What worked for me:

1. I was getting interviews, but no offers. This meant that I needed to improve my interviewing skills.
2. After receiving a rejection from yet another company (a small tech company), I wrote to the owner asking him on whether he had any insight on why he didn't hire me and how could I improve my interviewing skills. He really liked that and even invited me for a lunch so he could tell me more about the industry, what I did wrong, what I did right, etc. It didn't lead anywhere, but made me really try harder for the next interview, which happened to be the one that led to an offer.
3. I listened to about 10 hours of YouTube videos on how to interview, especially for an IT position. I felt more confident after the interview than ever before that I did well. I felt that I should at least get a 2nd interview. Instead, I got an offer a few days later.
4. I took a 2-day course in Tableau over the last summer and am currently taking Health IT class that my state is paying for. It shows the potential employer that you  are doing everything possible in order to stay relevant and you're serious about improving yourself. Look at your local community colleges for courses and ask about any that may be state-subsidized.
5. I was able to find a part-time job working in a kitchen for a small business which sells food in farmers markets. It got me out of the house and helped pay the bills. Do this, if you can, even if it's completely different from what you're trying to do. It’s what kept me going instead of taking another sales job.
6. Don't give up! I was sad, angry, cynical, disappointed, etc. I kept blaming everyone and everything for my failures. That's normal as job search is one of the most demoralizing things you can do. It makes you question your self-worth and your sanity.

336,You should stop participating in Indeed’s online assessments: and here’s why.,518,f9xgar,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f9xgar/you_should_stop_participating_in_indeeds_online/,121,"Let’s talk about Indeed Assessments.

Over my time of applying for jobs in the past, I have done a few of these so called assessments from Indeed. Personally, I will no longer be doing these, and neither should you. Here’s why. 

The job market is tough enough as it is and people who are applying to jobs day in and day out don’t need to waste anymore of their time. 

If the employer doesn’t see enough value in the applicant’s resume and experience (which also holds their contact information) and decides to automate one of the most important areas of researching job candidates, then that indicates to the job applicant that his/her respective company is a waste of time. 

It’s yet another way of attempting to get something for nothing by companies, which is the only thing that businesses revolve around these days. 

Indeed Assessments are gimmicks used by companies who are not capable of making job hiring decisions based on qualifications and interpersonal communication. 

People are more than happy to answer questions over the phone, in person, or email IF  the employer is willing to invest their time.

E: Can’t forget about the companies wanting you to film yourself answering useless questions and sending the video to them as part of an “interview” (thx to the people in the comments for reminding me)",1582769562.0,2020-02-26 21:12:42

I posted a while ago about the job search and how difficult it was for me as a recent graduate and as a first generation student with no prior network. I am happy to say that after 10 months of 400+ Applications, interviews with 75 companies, countless networking, prepping for interviews, and constantly being rejected leading to incredible self-doubt, I have finally received and accepted an offer I was content with. Although the job isn't exactly what I wanted to do out of the gate and is kind of unrelated to my major (Business/HR focus), I think it's a good stepping stone to launch my career, and experience that I can leverage for future opportunities.

It is safe to say that job searching is a rough journey especially as a recent grad, and I’ve learned a lot about myself as well as the many different types of interviews that are out there (Case Studies, One-way videos, Cognitive Assessments, etc.). For those that are still searching, keep your head up, know that your time will come, and even if it’s not the dream job or company you had wished for, it’ll still be a great starting/continuing point for the rest of your career! Your happiness and worth isn’t defined by the job offer and there isn’t a timeline for when you should get a job if you are a recent graduate (unless you have dire circumstances, of course)!

* **Company Name**
* **Position Title**
* **Date applied**
* **Response?**
* **Intro interview dates?**
* **How did it go?**
* **Scheduled next steps?**
* **Offer?**
* **Are you interested in working there?** (*this is my personal column to include feedback on how I feel about the company regardless of whether I've spoken with a person or not; it also allows me to gauge my level of interest*.)

This spreadsheet ensures that I constantly have a bird's eye view of what's going on and keeps me up to date on the status of jobs I've applied to. I also include a list of names of people I've spoken to.

Not sure if this kind of organization process would help anyone but it's certainly helped me in the past and kept the job search more predictable by having this sort of spreadsheet available to look at, update and modify.

In most cases, I've heard back from people 3-4 days after sending my résumé. With others, I've gotten an immediate response in about 24 hours -- this allows me to see if the recruiter has been really enthusiastic about speaking with me and gives me a level of hindsight to be able to gauge how quickly the company intends to hire for the position.

The best part about this spreadsheet is: **I know that I'm not re-submitting my application to a company I'm interested in and if I have an immediate rejection, I'm able to remove the company from one of my columns and replace it with another company to apply to.**

This has made job hunting and interviewing a lot smoother had I just wrote it down on a piece of paper, planner or notebook. I'm constantly updating this as a means to have full control of my job search and have more predictable results in the next steps of the interview process.

**Although you can't control whether you get the job or not, you certainly can improve your odds by taking a high-level look at your current situation on a day-to-day basis.**

Remember guys, folks are getting back into the swing of things after New Years so if you don't hear back from a recruiter right away, chances are they will soon get back to you. Things usually pick up around the second and third week of January so keep your hopes up!

**Best of luck to everyone in getting the job of their dreams in 2020!!**

It sucks, the constant rejection and lack of respect for your time and consideration is extremely hard to not take personally. It's very easy to spiral into depression and quickly start to question your own self worth, I've been there. I made it to five final interviews where the hiring manager decided to promote an internal candidate, I've had recruiters email me a rejection after several  site visits saying that they feared ""the work would not be very interesting or engaging to me on a daily level"" when all I really wanted was a paycheck and some stability. I've watched my dream-job appear on job boards then slip through my fingers. I've had multiple HR employees promise me they're in the midst of making final decisions then contact me weeks later to say they went with another applicant. I've had companies act like we're best friends and that they're so excited for me to join the team then hit me with a 180º days later in the form of a rejection, and I've been ignored by so so so many applications I just send off into the ether. I was terrified to open my inbox for months because all it really gave me was pain and a sense of self-loathing. 

Somehow throughout all of this I finally landed a job and while it's not my aforementioned dream job, it's really not that bad. My nine months of unemployment taught me a lot about humility and how not to treat or discriminate against applicants. My advice to anyone in this position would be to reach out to friends or former colleagues, I wish this wasn't the case but it seems almost near impossible to get a job without a recommendation or referral.  In a perfect world people would judge you for who you are and not who you know, we all need to work to break this cycle. Above all, don't give up hope and remember rejection letters are not a reflection of you as a person and oftentimes aren't even based on your experience and value - I promise they're usually the result of Jenny in accounting hiring her old roommate from Cornell ... as frustrating as that is maybe it will provide you with some solace.

357,"I was locked in at work this weekend for 39 hours with no food, sense of time, or outside communication due to a coworker's negligence. Should I expect/ask to be paid for this time?",493,3j5sep,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3j5sep/i_was_locked_in_at_work_this_weekend_for_39_hours/,215,"So on Saturday at 4pm, my department closed for the weekend. Me and one other coworker were there. Both my coworker an I have keys for the entire department. I tell him before he leaves, ""I'm going to go to the bathroom and change into some different clothes. I'll see you Monday.""

And I grab my backpack and go into the bathroom to change clothes. (I was going out that night.) I leave my purse on my office desk with my keys and phone. I probably spent about 5 minutes in the bathroom in total. When I leave the bathroom, all the lights are off. And all the doors are locked. All of them. My office door, and both the department's entrance. There's no windows in this hall or in the bathroom. My coworker forgot I was in the bathroom.

[Here's a visual.](http://i.imgur.com/M43AwZY.png) Essentially, I was locked in a hallway with an open bathroom. There was no light, no clocks, no food, and I had no landline to dial out on in this hallway. There was a sofa in the hallway that I essentially laid on for 39 hours straight (when I wasn't banging on the door). 

I had no food. I think the worst part though was having absolutely no way to tell time. With no windows or clocks, I felt like I was going mad. Luckily, I had water from the bathroom and a place to shit.

Soooo... this morning at 7am, my coworker arrived at work and was shocked to find me locked in. I called my boss on my phone, explained what happened (in the most kind way I could, but I was understandably irate). I told her I was going home for the day even though I was scheduled to work Monday.

Despite it being month-end, she said that was fine. Of course, I thought about it during the 39 hours, but since I'm going in to work tomorrow... I really should bring it up... should I expect to get paid for that 39 hours? I was technically on the clock the entire time, even though I wasn't working.

I know people who get snowed in at work typically don't get paid when they don't work, but that's more or less foreseeable. This was due to a coworkers negligence. And it was fucking terrible. The claustrophobia can't be described.

What do you guys think?

359,The Hidden Cost of Accepting A Bad Job Offer,493,dgzte9,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dgzte9/the_hidden_cost_of_accepting_a_bad_job_offer/,127,"I was unemployed for 16 months after leaving my first job out of college.

It felt like every month of that time period, I'd discover a new rock bottom.  My parents were kinda supporting me when they remembered and I was too embarassed to ask out right, so I'm gonna be honest there were days where I didn't eat.

I'd run out of things like toothpaste, soap, sugar. During the tail end of that 16 months I was completely *desperate*.

I was applying for anything. Literally anything, even jobs I was severely overqualified for (or so I thought). In my mind, that means I have a higher chance of being accepted. Looking back now, now that I did get a low paying dead end job before getting an appropriate one, I know the hidden pitfalls of looking or settling for a job-I'm-only-doing-so-I-can-pay-rent.


*1. Looking for a job IS a full-time job*

It might not be obvious, but job hunting is a full time job. It requires you to invest hours on checking ads, filling dozens of applications a day, checking your emails almost hourly, being available to be called (recruiters rarely call back), going to multiple levels of interview that each takes half a day...

And most importantly, they all happen within the regular office hours. If you take on a job that makes you unavailable during those times, you'll significantly decrease your chances of finding a better job.

*2. Looking for a low-paying job is not easier*

I was rejected about 23 times from job that doesn't even require a degree. Why? Those jobs aren't interested that I have a degree, they want someone that could do the job. Yes, the dreaded word, *experience*..

Yes so I have a degree in accounting but do I have a clue about how to be a seamstress assistant? Or a bakery personnel? 

For these places, your overqualificiation means nothing. They want someone that's done this before.

And hunting for these jobs require the same amount of time and effort, honestly.

*3. Once you do a job once, that's all they'll ever offer you*

People that have worked in call centers, serving crews, secretaries, and the like knows what I am talking about. 

I worked for a call center and no matter what position I was applying for, I always get reverted back to ""Well, you applied to be a data analyst/bookeper/accountant but I see you have experience in phone calls, we actually have an opening for---""

No.

 Mr. Recruiter, you see, I am applying here so I can *quit* that type of job.

Accepting a job that youre overqualified for achors you to that level. I am gonna say that not having any experience at all is better than having experience in a low-paying poaition that has nothing to do with your degree, if youre young.

Me leaving out my first job on my resume got me more job interviews in positions that suited my degree better.",1570937950.0,2019-10-12 23:39:10

I've tried networking, applying directly to companies instead of quick applies via LinkedIn/Indeed, have written more cover letters than I can count, have revised my resume multiple times (including getting professional resume writers and peers to give feedback), and it's all making zero difference. 

I can't help but think that it's because of something wrong with me. I get the constant feeling that I'm not desirable enough in the eyes of ANY employer. I just feel like a joke. Even with a Bachelor's Degree and a couple years of work experience and even some freelance portfolio work, it just feels like any employer couldn't give less of a shit about what someone in my demographic and experience can offer.

Like.... ***No. That's not an emergency.***

*I'm furious.* Now I'm stuck here several extra hours I didn't plan to be here at all (the other two guys on site are maxed with overtime time, so there's no way out of it for me), and for a completely nonsense reason. She isn't sick. She didn't get in a car accident. He can take an Uber or a taxi or the bus.

This is far from the first time she's been late or even no call no showed. We are perpetually short staffed because I work for a security company, and the post I work at has very stringent rules such as requiring a minimum of 2 years experience (among other things), and yet my boss constantly has interviewees come in who don't meet the requirements that he cannot bend at all.

Anyone who has worked security probably already knows that turnover is high, and calling off is extremely difficult and can lead to getting fired if it's short noticed.... but she gets away with it because we cannot afford to fire anyone. There just isn't enough in the budget or manpower to cover that much overtime.

And all of this happened through one of my other coworkers when she called the building and not even speaking directly to our boss (who's usually work from home and on site only occasionally). The coworker she called then had to tell our boss, who sounded like he was asleep. I'm highly recommended to not call him to complain that this is bullshit.

Security sucks but it's the only thing that's been reliable for employment for me since the pandemic hit (I used to work as a contractor with big events like SXSW or other conventions but there's just not enough of that type of work to make ends meet anymore). And while I've been applying for jobs, most companies have already started to more or less wind down since Christmas is next week.

Wish I could quit on the spot but I really can't afford to.

370,What I learned from getting laid off from a basic administrative assistant job,486,e8nuha,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e8nuha/what_i_learned_from_getting_laid_off_from_a_basic/,80,"I (26F) recently got terminated without cause from my former job as an Administrative Assistant at a student organization. It was a nice environment to work in, in the beginning (I started this past April). Then eventually I found myself unable to put up with the menial tasks, the below average salary, and the fact that there was no opportunity for growth/advancement in this tiny organization of 4 full-time staff members (including me).

So since July 2019, I had been looking for another job. I must have submitted at least 70 applications since July, for roles related to administration. I gladly used my sick leave hours and personal leave hours to go to job interviews. However, I kept on getting turned down. 

Shortly after, my work ethic at my current job was slipping. It wasn't even a difficult job but I mentally left it soon after I started searching for other jobs. There was/is a bit of egotism in me as well; I thought that I was capable of landing a better job than this admin assistant role, that I didn't go through five years of university just to be assisting others with no sense of agency. 

I thought I could keep working there while secretly applying to other places because I was friendly, cheerful, nice. I thought personality was still important. 

Obviously I was wrong; results matter infinitely more in the workplace. I was called into my manager's office and was told that they have decided to terminate me without cause, effective on the same day. They gave me severance plus vacation pay, on top of  two more weeks of regular pay. I didn't even care about that anymore. I packed my stuff and left that office in a daze, half an hour later. 

The next five days were the lowest I had ever felt in my life. I went to speak to a counsellor for the first time in at least eight years. I sent out ten resumes a day so I don't go crazy. I thought I finally had actual depression because I no longer had any appetite.

On the sixth day after my termination, while I was essentially sulking on the bus on my way to the library to send more resumes, I received an unexpected phone call from a director from the last interview I went to, before I was terminated from my old job. He said they've decided to offer me the position of Academic Advising Student Support. Out of all the jobs that I had applied for, this was the one I wanted the most. 

I was nearly in tears because I no longer had any expectations of life turning out for the better.  I don't have connections and I don't go out of my way to network — I am on my own when it comes to finding a job, so this news really turned my life around again. I start on December 16th. 

I have thought things would have been even better if the phone call came BEFORE my termination day, so I could have resigned instead of being terminated. I could have beat my former manager to it, in a sense, and not have to feel so ashamed.

But as masochistic as it sounds, I deserved some emotional pain. Otherwise I wouldn't have learned my lesson as much —which is that results trump personality in the workplace, and also do not let your job searching affect your current job in any way! It hurts to lose all your old colleagues just like that. 

I hope anyone reading this can relate and weigh in if they have experienced similar sentiment.

I know this isnt even related to my job function but sometimes this stuff is just too much.,482,g5y5pn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g5y5pn/has_anyone_actually_stopped_caring_about_a/,149,"I recently applied for a position and was interviewed, etc. I like the company. I worked there a year prior as a temp. The thing is, my contract ended maybe 3 months ago so now I am officially an external applicant so to speak. I applied for multiple positions and other companies as well but figured because of CV19, it's best to stay here.

So I check my job portal and it says extended contingent offer. I'm like, okay. Maybe I'll get an email or something this week. I'm not going to hustle them if they're already updated the portal. I check today and it says ""accepted contingent offer"" on the portal, and now I'm like wtf. I didnt have a chance to negotiate, there was no paper, there was no communication with me about anything. In the interview however, my current boss did say  theyd like me to stay. But forgive me if I'm mistaken, but normally I myself have to agree to their offer, not they accept it without.

Just like any normal person, we usually try to weigh our options etc. I do not know if they are just assuming I'm wanting to stay and they are my only choice, because it's not and I also made that clear in the interview.

Off topic but one of my other interviews was 8 rounds. 8 ROUNDS for an associate/mid tier level position. This doesnt include the BS one way interview and HR.",1587577081.0,2020-04-22 13:38:01
379,"If You have the type of boss who tells you it is illegal to talk about your wages they are wrong. It is legal, and usually means they are hiding how cheap they pay you.",480,6vqza7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6vqza7/if_you_have_the_type_of_boss_who_tells_you_it_is/,67,"So the easy question.....as in the title says.  Yes you can talk about your wages in the states.   This covers most employees in the united states as provided by the National Labor Relations Act. Some exceptions exist that are as follows as provided by the NLRB. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

employed by Federal, state, or local government (this is public info anyways due to record laws)

employed as agricultural laborers

employed in the domestic service of any person or family in a home

employed by a parent or spouse

employed as an independent contractor

employed as a supervisor (supervisors who have been discriminated against for refusing to violate the NLRA may be covered)

employed by an employer subject to the Railway Labor Act, such as railroads and airlines


---------------------------------------------------------------------

So what does this mean? That means it is damn hard to actually prove this was the reason you got fired. Voice recordings, emails, and other co-workers standing up for you is the only way to really prove you got fired for talking about your wages.   Most folks work in At-Will states which means that you can be fired for any reason including not giving a reason.  So the risk of talking about your wages still do exist. 

You may be granted increased rights, like Colorado so you should check to see if you are lucky on that.

380,"Thanks, r/jobs! Rang in the new year with a new job! Here are some things I found helpful from this sub and other online sources:",480,adnsaw,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/adnsaw/thanks_rjobs_rang_in_the_new_year_with_a_new_job/,39,"Tips in applying:

* If you don't have 10+ years of experience, find a way to fit your resume onto one page
* A small, but extremely helpful change I made was keeping my resume single-spaced. When you hit enter after a bullet point, Word adds a few pts between each line by default. Highlight the area you want to edit and change the spacing in the paragraph section of the toolbar to 1.0, or by right-clicking and selecting ""paragraph."" This reduced the wasted white space in my resume and gave me more room to add additional valuable information. After this change, I was invited for an interview every 3 jobs I applied to!
* Don't wait until you land an interview before you read up on the company. However many stars they are rated is not enough to give you a good outlook. I got an email for an interview and read that the company had serious harassment issues that were not being addressed. Nope, nope, NOPE.
* If you're applying to jobs by the masses, and you don't want to bother customizing each resume to each job, create a base resume with everything that you can bring to the table. Then when you are applying, you can copy and paste the experience that matters to the employer (be mindful of any time gaps). Also, I made sure to tailor my skills section each time by picking qualities listed in the job ad
* Edit: It has been brought to my attention that you don’t always need a cover letter. Refer to #3 of the following bullet to see how writing cover letters helped me beyond my application :)
* I'm sure you've heard it before but TRASH YOUR GENERIC FILL IN THE BLANK COVER LETTER. Start from scratch each time. Pull 2-3 key skills from your resume that are in the job description and show proof in 1-3 sentence stories from previous jobs/experiences. I get it. It takes longer. But your hour or two spent writing a cover letter tailored to the job will benefit you in a number of ways:

1. You will improve the quality of your application DUH
2. After a few applications, what used to take you 2 hours, will take you 30 mins, then 10
3. As you pick up your pace typing up these cover letters, you are training yourself to think faster. When interviewers ask you questions like ""Why are you a good fit for this position?"" I can assure you, they will be easier to answer because you've practiced this over and over in your cover letters.

* Don't stop applying. I primarily used Craigslist, Indeed, and Simply Hired to stay updated on openings, and almost always applied directly through the hiring company's job portal if possible. Of course, there were duplicates among the platforms, but keep in mind not everyone is going to post on Indeed.

Tips for interviewing:

* For phone interviews, have your resume, job posting, notepad, and pencil handy. Refer to your resume often. Write any questions that might come up for you to ask after the interview, or follow-up interview
* For in-person interviews. bring several copies of your resume, and another for yourself. You can write additional notes in the margins of your resume to glance at if you're prone to brain farts like me (lol)
* Interviewing for a job that you don't want might sound like a waste of time, but even if it's not one of your top choices, do it anyways. Even in interviews, you get better through practice! Not to mention, interviews are for both parties to learn about each other. You might discover that you're actually really interested in the job after all.
* FIRM HANDSHAKES, EVERYONE! FIRM!
* Send a thank you after each interview stage! Yeah, it feels like you're being annoying, but I don't see the harm in doing it. I feel like it solidifies your interest to the employer.

Alright that's it. This sub helped me loads and had me ""working"" 10 hours a day perfecting and submitting applications. Feel free to add things I missed, and critique points I made. If it matters, I spent 3 months casually applying, and less than 1 month seriously applying before getting an offer I liked. Be patient and work hard. There is zero reward in giving up. Job searching is a job in itself. Good luck, everyone! I hope someone out there will find this helpful!



Edit:
A few things to note: I have never been fired, have viable reasons (that GOOD employers would accept) for any gaps in my employment history, and have about 5 years of work experience in different industries. The jobs I applied for leaned towards entry-level, but most required at least 1 year of experience in a similar role (this is where I used my cover letter to demonstrate transferable skills).

My bad - I hope this is sufficient!

I graduated with my bachelor's in May and have been casually perusing job postings since... 2017. This summer I was able to work with the company that I interned with between January and May, but only part-time and not a great pay; plus, when the grant that funds my wage ends, I'm out. During this time I worked at another job to get me to ~40 hours a week.

With my degree (community health) I knew I wanted to get into health-related policy or program analysis since I started taking classes but didn't know if that would actually happen because it seems very niche. Consider it my ""dream"" job (as of now... I'm totally aware this can change as I learn more about the industry and as I get older).

Two weeks ago, I interviewed with a huge non-profit that focuses on child well-being.  The position is a program analyst for a specific department.  The interviewer (who will be my manager) told me she was a bit wary at first because of my lack of professional experience. They preferred 2-3 years; I have ~1 year of relevant experience. She gave me a shot anyways.  I interviewed in-person on Tuesday, and received a phone call yesterday offering me the job! 

The salary was a range and I figured I'd be the minimum since I have less experience.  They actually offered $2k more than I expected! Considering the fact that public health is a low-paying industry, I'm happy with my salary + benefits (I'm in a two-income household). 

I'm just so excited and wanted to share. I love looking through this subreddit because it helped me through rejections and gave me some hope. :)

Typically even if I don't like a place, I suck it up and try to push through. But there have been two times where I had to leave the workplace due to toxicity, one time resulting in me quitting on the spot. 

&#x200B;

The first instance was when I was a delivery boy for like three days. I ended up only making $0.50 (50 cents, you read that right), an hour for the work I was doing. They gave me a broken GPS to try to navigate deliveries in the rain, and the guy slapped you a 5 spot for every hour you worked, regardless of your tips. You also had to make change with your tips, and pay for your own gas. After almost getting in an accident due to the shitty GPS, I came back with the order and left. My dumb ass actually said I was open to trying the place out again for employment, but I was a kid and it was before I knew my worth as an employee. Glad I left though. You live and you learn.

&#x200B;

The second instance was when I was fresh out of college. I was dirt poor with no job offers and needed work, so a supermarket I worked for in college was the move. I got decent hours, but the store was a mess. Management wa in complete disarray. I waited 3 hours to be interviewed on my interview day bc they were ""busy"" (no more busy than any other retail outlet honestly), they ""forgot"" to promote me due to staffing (even though I signed a contract saying I was promoted), and the environment was horrible. Fights in the store daily, cops there every day, people trying to get each other fired, managers exploiting mentally handicapped employees to clean waste material up even though managers were the only people certified to do so, favoritism, department beefs, homeless people all over the place, alcoholics in the store, lecherous creeps preying on young people (myself included). It was nasty. I didn't realize exactly how bad that job was until I started the next job after that. It wasn't sunshine and rainbows, but it was fundamentally doable, and I met some cool people there.

396,"I’ve reviewed 1,000+ good (and bad) resumes. Here are my tips on perfecting yours.",464,ijyjwk,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ijyjwk/ive_reviewed_1000_good_and_bad_resumes_here_are/,104,"Hey guys! So over the past few years, I’ve looked at 1,000+ resumes and analyzed what differentiates a good resume from the bad. And, well, I ended up learning a lot.

I’ve been lurking on Reddit for like forever and wanted to give a bit back to the community. So, I created this mega-list of ALL the best resume tips & tricks I’ve learned over the years.

Hope you guys find it useful.

So, the tips are...

1. **Use a professional email.** This one sounds like a no-brainer, but you’d be surprised by how many people still use extremely casual emails ([bigjosh69@gmail.com](mailto:bigjosh69@gmail.com), anyone?)
2. **Always double-check your contact information.** You typo that phone number or email, and you’re not getting a callback.
3. **Try to mention achievements over responsibilities when possible.** HR knows what your responsibilities are. What they WANT to know is how you stand out from the rest of the candidates. Keep in mind, though, that some positions don’t have achievements as such. In cases like that, it’s OK to go for responsibilities.

**Good Example**: Hit and surpassed the monthly KPI by 20% for 5 months in a row

**Bad Example**: Generated leads through cold calling

4. **Mention only relevant work experience**. If you’re applying for a job in sales, HR doesn’t care about your experience in accounting.

5. **If you are a student with not a lot of work experience**, jam-pack your resume with other experiences.

Think, extracurricular activities, personal projects you’ve worked on, volunteering, whatever else you can come up with. Don’t have much of that, either? Proactively work towards getting skills and experiences that are going to be useful for your future job.

In this case, you can even fill up your resume with work experience that’s not that relevant. Did you wait tables during the summer but now you are applying for a marketing job?

You can still mention it - it shows that you’ve done SOME work in your life, and aren’t afraid to get your hands dirty.

6. **Back up your experiences with data & numbers.** All the entries on your resume should be super-specific. This allows you to stand out from the other candidates & show the recruiter that you’re a high-achiever.

**DO**: Managed and optimized the client’s Facebook ad account, increasing the ad ROI from 42% to 65%

**DON’T**: Managed the client’s Facebook ad account

7. **Are you about to switch careers?** Mention it in your resume summary. Do something like:

*“Sales professional with 5 years+ years of experience looking to transition into the position of a front-end web developer. Previous experience developing websites for 3 local business clients.”*

This shows that you’re not just applying to random jobs - you’re ACTUALLY trying to transition into a new field. The 2nd sentence can be used to show the experience you DO have (if you have any).

8. **DON’T spray and pray**. Most job-seekers go all-out with their job-search, applying for dozens of jobs per day. This, if you ask me, is counterproductive. You’re better off hand-picking the 5 best jobs each day, and tailoring your application to each of them.

9. **Speaking of tailoring** \- t’s pretty generic advice to “tailor your resume to the job you’re applying for,” but what does it mean in, y’know, practice?

So here’s how this works - most people make a single resume, and apply to dozens of positions with it.

The optimal approach is, instead, to create a different variation of your resume for each position you’re applying for, and apply to a handful of positions each day instead.

As for how to do the actual tailoring, first off, you need to read the job description in-depth. Then, go through your resume and see if you’ve mentioned all the skills and responsibilities that are required for the position.

In most cases, you’ll see that there ARE several essential skills and responsibilities that you DO have, but you didn't mention on your resume because you just didn’t think they were that important. This, usually, makes a huge difference.

10. **DON’T go over 1 page**. Common advice, but again, a TON of people disregard this. Unless you’re a senior professional with 20+ years of experience, there’s no excuse for going over 1 page.

The recruiter doesn’t care about every single thing you’ve done in your life - they care about your relevant work experiences.

If you have 10 years of work experience in accounting, for example. 80% of your resume should be all about that, and 20% about any other experiences that help build up your profile for the position.

You shouldn’t mention what you did in high school, for example. Or which extracurricular activities you did in uni.

Surprisingly, students tend to be the ones that make 2-3 page resumes. Since they have a ton of extracurricular activities from university and want to stand out, they just jam everything they’ve done at uni into the resume.

Or, they also tend to go the other way around - they just mention their university, classes they’ve taken, and end up with a half-a-page resume. This isn’t a good approach, either.

11. **Don’t fluff**. “Critical thinker” “good communicator” “strong teamwork skills.” What do these words have in common?

Well, it’s that every single recent graduate stuffs these in their resume. Avoid generic buzzword terms, because, let’s face it - they don’t help, and they are just space-fillers.

12. **Don’t include a photo**. You want to get a job, not a date.

13. **Use DocSend to track your resume.** This is a very little-knock hack, but it works pretty cool.

DocSend is a tool where you can upload your CV, and whenever anyone looks at it, you get a detailed run-down of how long they were looking at it, and when.

This is useful for a bunch of reasons, including:

You’ll know if the recruiter never looked at your resume. This means that your resume probably got lost in their inbox, and you should ping them.

Or, option 2, the recruiter looks at your resume for <5 seconds. This means that your resume doesn’t prove to the HR that you can do the job, and it requires further work.

Or, if they DO look at your resume for more than a minute, that means that they’re interested, and will probably get in touch soon.

Unfortunately, DocSend doesn’t work if you’re applying for bigger companies that ask you to fill in an application on their website. Small businesses or startups, though, are free game.

14. **If you have a B.A., don’t include your high school information**.

15. **Proof-read your resume**. Use Grammarly for this, or ask a friend to give you a 2nd opinion

16. **Feel free to include a hobbies section**, but ONLY if you have space to fill, and no other relevant experience to fill it with. Hobbies are a good way to show a bit of your personality, but it’s not what’s going to get you the job.

Most recruiters are 50/50 on the section - some think it’s a waste of time, others think it helps humanize the candidate a bit more (and you might end up talking about the hobbies in the interview)

17. **Follow up on your application**. Sometimes, your application ends up lost in the recruiter’s inbox - and that’s OK. HRs make human errors, too. Pro tip: use an email tracking tool like Streak to see if the recruiter opened your email. If they didn’t, you know for a fact that you need to follow up.

18. Finally, keep in mind that when it comes to resumes & recruitment, **a lot is opinion-based**. Every single recruiter or HR manager has their own opinion on the resume specifics.

Some of them hate the hobbies section, others advocate for it.

Some of them recommend removing the resume objective section, others think it's useful.

If you find conflicting opinions on the web, don't just take either side as gospel - try to understand why they're recommending something, and how you can use it to your advantage.

...And that’s about it! Hope you guys found the tips useful ;) Let me know if you have any questions / feedback / completely disagree with something I wrote.",1598911446.0,2020-08-31 18:04:06

I’ve been applying for a new job for about a month, and I’ve been noticing an increasingly amount of companies that choose to either not disclose their information (such as leaving their company name as Confidential), do strictly commission work, or have some discrepancies in their listings vs what they actually offer. 

To give an example, I had an interview where the pay range was set 30-40k a year. I asked for 35, well within what they’re offering. Instead the lady interviewing me told me they just put that so people would apply but it would be hard to realistically get that approved. What gives? 

I’ve also had THREE LEGIT companies reach out, schedule a phone interview with me, then never call! I email them back as a follow up, they never respond to emails, just radio silence. I’ve never had this happen in my entire adult life where a company will flake on YOU. I don’t know if it’s that I haven’t looked for a new job in a few years and this is how the career industry has shifted but this sucks. 

Also, I’m starting to notice higher education and experience requirements for lower pay? I’ve seen postings for Bachelors for $20-25k a year salary.",1562292857.0,2019-07-04 22:14:17

I’m new to this department and they were called into a meeting while I was on break so when I get back to my station there was nobody there. I head into the conference room where all my group was and as I walk in the head of HR Says to me “hey why don’t you have a seat” I sit “we’ve heard you’ve been sexually assaulting some of your coworkers and we would like to talk to you about that”  I’m embarrassed and confused as can be and I freeze. Then she says “just kidding” and dismissed us all. I head back to work and everyone is weird towards me and probably assumed I got us all in trouble. I’m a shy person and I keep mostly to myself and only talk to those when I’m comfortable with them. 

The next day (today) I brainstormed with my dad (supervisor at a different company) and he had talked with his colleagues and we came up with some key points to bring up to the head of HR. I told her things like that is a sensitive topic to be joking about to someone who has no clue what they’re walking into. They don’t know what kind of week I’ve had. Unprofessional and uncalled for. And what kind of messages that sends to the rest of the people not only about me but her as HR. All she said was that she apologizes and that she’s learned her lesson. I turned in my badge and she panics. Our company has a hard time keeping workers so it’s not in her best interest to lose me. She offers me a new shift, an apology, you name it to keep me. I told her I’ve made up my mind and that this was the icing on the cake. (They move me around and improperly train me) 

I may have over reacted but I had to stick up for myself. I will be going back to my staffing agency for a new job on Monday so I’m not worried about my finances. I only wish there was another member of HR in the room so she was held accountable for her actions to a superior but she wasn’t. I wasn’t in there for revenge or special treatment. I wanted to let her know her words effected me and I didn’t wish to continue with my employment there. 

Did I handle this correctly or did i shoot my self in the foot/ over react?

Feel free to ask them for advice.",464,f3j0uy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f3j0uy/just_a_reminder_job_recruiters_want_you_to_get/,89,"This is only for third party recruiters. Some large companies have recruiters in house, and I'm not talking about that situation.

First of all, recruiters are legit. I thought maybe they were scams since someone contacting me for a job sounded too good to be true. That was a long time ago, and I've dealt with them a lot since then.

A recruiter's performance, and sometimes even pay, is largely dependent on them placing people in jobs. If you get the job, that's good for them as well.

I see questions on here all the time about interacting with recruiters. I'll drop a few notes I've heard/experienced directly from recruiters, but would love to hear other thoughts, and let me know if I'm wrong on any of this.

Ask recruiters about the hiring manager/position/what they're looking for. They'll be likely to give you some good details because as stated above, they're rooting for you. They've also possibly interacted with the hiring manager and have some details that aren't on the application. They might let you know really great details in your history you should mention in an interview.

Feel free to ask about pay. I hated bringing this up in an interview, but a recruiter won't mind. Also this could stop you from undervaluing the position when asked what you want to be paid. Also ask them any details you think might be deal breakers. No reason to spend a bunch of interviews not realizing you're gonna hate a job.

Recruiters are less likely to turn you down for something very minor. They may leave some things out speaking to the recruiter or even critique you.

Once you are out, they won't be afraid to let you know. A couple times I've just been ghosted, but feel free to ask where you are in the process. (again no recruiter is gonna throw you out as a candidate cause you emailed them one too many times)

If you don't want the job, tell them straight up. I don't know why but I used to be nervous about saying this like I was breaking up with someone. They don't want to waste time with someone not interested, so it's no big deal.

Try to keep in touch with them. Add them in LinkedIn or something. I've had them call me back a month later asking if I was still looking.

That's all I can think of.

EDIT: since this is in contest mode, I'm going to put the most common/best comments here since they won't rise to the top. The things I missed on are basically the negative, which exist. I think this is partially because recruiters for someone with 6 years+ experience is different from someone with very little experience.

A lot of recruiters don't look to far into candidates before reaching out. This means they'll contact you with jobs you'd clearly have no interest. Another reason to ask questions (salary) immediately

""They dont want you to get THE job they want you to get A job"" most probably don't care whether it's a good fit on either side which is why you should immediately start asking questions.

They will ghost you. Some (once you've got more experience I'd say) will want to keep in touch cause maybe they'll try again with you later. For some, once you're out of contention, you're useless to them, and they don't seemingly care about their reputation. I've even had an appointment set up and been ""stood up"" (only once)

There are absolutely bad experiences but... it's job hunting. This sub is incredibly negative, and it's hard to blame, BECAUSE job hunting sucks. I'd still say it's slightly less awful than other ways of job hunting.

I am not talking about staffing agencies. Those are totally different, have their uses, but also downsides.",1581665409.0,2020-02-14 02:30:09

He was putting the meeting off all this week. ""We'll talk about your email tomorrow,"" he must've said over 4 times.

Today as we were driving together, he says, ""So about your raise.. how much are you making now?""
I told him 55k.

I told him between 6-8k.
""Let's make your salary 62.5k starting July 1st.""

I cannot believe he actually gave me the raise. I was SURE he was mad at me for even asking. Earlier this week I spoke to an office girl who has been with the school for 3 years and she said I was out of my mind to ask, that the normal raise was 3%. I was completely sure the talk about my raise would leave me feeling like an idiot who'd asked for too much.

But he gave it to me! I can't believe it. 

After we talked money he told me he really appreciated me and that he was concerned because I never took lunch. And then he confided in me about a co-worker.

Just wanted to share that I've finally quit my job. It's been SO long overdue. 

Glassdoor reviews says it all - horrible management, place is crumbling and a mess. Workload is CRAZY for very little pay and constant micromanaging!

I quit Thursday morning the moment I logged in when I saw an email for me from the managers. It was really the last straw. 

At that specific moment - I felt like an animal held in captivity and is first scared of stepping into wilderness and freedom haha!

But now I've never slept better in the last few years!!!! 


I left on my terms, just up and leave and flipped the bird (not literally). 

Those who want context and the juice read on:

They were nitpicking about putting in a PTO for a day the week before where I was sick and I worked a few short hours but made up for it in the week. Note we've worked OT, never get paid since it's salaried -  and kind of expected to work ot (on the weekends even)! And now they were being like this despite hearing me being taken to the emergency!

And in this pandemic we had a pay cut but the workload was CRAZY! 

They started getting all nitpicky like where were you on the 8th, we did not see you online from x pm to x pm, (did you *even* work tone?). 

I just lost it. I'm like y'know what I'm not gonna even entertain this. 

Prepared my resignation, mailed it to one manager and HR. 

Then replied to that nitpicky email by saying - ""sorry with my current illness and with my direct family member afflicted with covid I don't think I can meet the demands of this job anymore or handle the workload/stress any further - I've handed my resignation so there is no need to waste any further time discussing this""!

Then I sent out a goodbye last day email to the entire company.

Edit: Just want to add, I'm not impulsive. The company is abusive, this was long overdue.

Even though my wife and I are in decent financial shape I have been becoming more and more depressed about not being able to find a job. 
I saw an ad for a neighborhood restaurant needing a part time dishwasher so I said what the hell. I sent them an email and didn’t include my resume since that would be pointless. The owner responded back immediately and asked for me to come by that afternoon. Even though I was raised in restaurants, dad was a chef, mom a waitress, I told them that I had no experience. They hired me on the spot.
So here I am in my 40’s scrubbing pots and I can honestly say it’s the happiest I’ve been in a while. I get to prep which I enjoy, I’m a little rough around the edges so it helps me fit in with the kitchen crew, it’s nice to be around people again, and I enjoy the energy when things get busy. It also constantly brings back good memories of my dad who passed away just before I became unemployed. 
I am still aggressively pursuing other positions in my chosen field since being a cook or a chef is not the lifestyle I want for my family however for now, the kitchen is a happy place for me.

I'm sorry if this turns into a long winded rant, but I've never felt so defeated and alone in the world and I guess I need the comfort of internet strangers. It's weird being 26 and still not having a direction in life. I have vague ideas but no motivation to act on them. It's like my life is a puzzle but some pieces are missing, some got chewed by the dog and some are just on fire for no good reason. Here's my story:

I loved writing as a kid. Always wrote stories, kick ass essays, the best book reports. Popular fanfics, popular roleplays, parents hated it. Forced me to do sports. Hated sports. Conflicted all through out middle and high school because my interests (writing, art, design, building, creativity in general) were shelved in favor of sports and math.

I hate sports and math. I played lacrosse for 4 years and from the day I walked on the field to the day I walked off (in dramatic fashion, by hurtling my stick across the field while my teammates sobbed because it was the last high school game) I had no idea how to play the game. Math? Still need my fingers to count. I can write like a beast though. Never forget a compliment I got my freshmen year of college; ""You're a whale of a writer.""

So went to college for a stupid major. Realized it was stupid, tried to switch. Couldn't. Spent college wasting time on tumblr, putting low effort into classes, passing but unremarkable. Got hired off my internship for a wonderful job. Loved job. Graduated college. Spent almost 2 years with job before getting laid off for financial reasons. Hopeless and lost, took a server gig before going back to my university for a full-time position. 3 years later, here we are. Still hopeless, still lost. No wonderful skills (MS Office bullshit, Google cloud, some University-specific questions) and absolutely *no* desire to stay here for my life. Here's where the title of this post comes in:

All around me I see people do the same ol' same ol' every day. My co-worker has been working the same job for 10 years. I don't know how she does it. My old co-worker from a different position can almost effortlessly climb the corporate ladder. I have zero interest in being a higher ed manager or director. My position now is stupidly simple and low grade but I still manage to fuck it up. It's like my body, from my two stupid half-eaten brain cells to my alcohol-ravaged liver are working tirelessly to get me fired from this job, because being stuck in an office 8 hours a day is so counter-productive to what I want to do.

Why do I hate office jobs? I hate that I'm stuck in an office. I hate that I can't change my schedule or work flexible hours. I can't be creative. I pitch ideas and solutions, they get shot down. I'm picked on and bullied in my current position. I'm basically an errand girl. I make copies and send emails and fuck around on Reddit. I'm so mindlessly bored and everyone is so rude. I've gotten fat and my posture sucks from sitting all day. I throw up from stress and suffer terrible stomachaches. My job is chaotic and disorganized and people get mad at me when I don't have time to show them how to change a font in Word (I am not kidding, a professor I work with literally does not know how to use Microsoft Word). There's no way for me to move up in my current department and the environment is so toxic I can't even focus on trying to take online classes. I signed up for grad school but discovered I hate the content and went to school for the wrong reasons.

I've made so many poor choices in life I can't seem to make any further decisions on my own. 

Obviously I can't stay in this office. I've been here a year already.

So what do I want to do? Honestly I don't know. I just thought people got office jobs and lived that life and hated themselves until stress made them blow their skulls apart. Not to be morbid but now I understand why people just all of a sudden fling themselves off their balconies or suck down bleach until their insides melt into goo. I can't comprehend my own mindset, but it's terrible in that I despise my office job *so much* but I need it to live. I need health insurance and an income. But I want to quit. I want a part-time job doing something cool, that I know I'll enjoy. I want a job at Whole Foods because I like the company and I like their benefits. I want to write as a side hustle and make bank at it. But that's so incorrect from how I was raised that quitting my job and just wandering into the Great Unknown fills me with so much dread, and fear....but not as much hatred and anger I feel at being stuck in my current job. It's a violent cycle. I hate where I am but I'm too afraid to make changes.

I don't even know why I'm posting, because I know I should feel thankful for this job when so many out there are struggling. It's why I feel broken, useless, and a burden. I cannot appreciate what so many others want. But I want to hear what other people have done in similar situations to mine. I know my story isn't unique. I'm just a mid-20s nobody unable to cope with the harsh reality of the world. I want to know how others got themselves out of times like these, just so I can know that better days are on the horizon.

Thanks for reading.

I came in on a regular day, worked, went to lunch, did some more work and was called into my manager's office. She asked me to bring my laptop. In the room was a senior member of HR. She asked me to close the door. I knew in that moment that this was it, The End. I didn't feel anger, shame, or sadness. I responded to their questions, asked a couple of my own. I went home, gathered a couple of peripherals, and returned to drop them off with my badge and my parking pass. Then I went home. It was 2:30pm on Monday.

The first thing that hit me was this question, ""what am I going to do with the rest of the day?"" I've been reading this subreddit and others for years so I new what I had to do. I applied for UI. I checked my finances. I even applied for 3 jobs before my partner came home. 

With a good amount of anxiety I told her we needed to talk. I sat down with her and explained that I been fired that day, that I was okay, that we would be okay. I thought she would cry. I thought she would be angry at me, at my boss, at the company. I did not think she would laugh. ""I thought you were ready to quit months ago,"" she said. ""At least now you get unemployment benefits."" We talked and laughed at the absurdity of it all from her point of view. 

I called my parents. They were worried and asked if I needed anything. I told them no, that I had enough saving to last me through the summer and that UI would extend that even further. They said they loved me and that they were proud. 

I held it together for Christmas. Present were already paid for and I wasn't travelling. It was hard to relax, but I had the support of the people that I loved. It was the first day of work after New Years that everything finally hit me. I'd planned to take time off anyway, but now I was on borrowed time. One night after we'd eaten dinner and were sitting on the couch I broke down, ""My boss disliked me so much that she'd rather have me gone then deal with me anymore."" I had never in my life felt so ashamed. I cried.

It took me three weeks to build up the courage to reach out to my contacts and check in. I was afraid that a previous boss at the same company would *know*, that he would judge me for failing, and that my time at the company was a complete failure. I was wrong. He was supportive, encouraging, and said that he would keep an eye out for openings and would happily be a reference. Another prior boss was even more positive. 

For three months and twenty applications I heard nothing. Not one email, call, or letter. Then, in the span of two weeks, I got three calls. A recruiting agency liked my profile and wanted to shop me out for a position just a little out of my field. Two companies wanted to start interviews. They weren't exactly what I wanted, but for the first time in what felt like a lifetime, I had something to work towards. Feeling emboldened I called a friend of mine that worked at one company to check-in. We talked about his work and family. It felt good. 

One week later I got another call. My friend had referred me to a recruiter. The recruiter had two positions and thought I would be a good fit. The positions looked great. That was a Wednesday. I had an interview Thursday afternoon. They gave me an offer Friday. I accepted Monday. I started work on Wednesday, two weeks after I called my friend.

For three months I thought that I would not be able to find work. One conversation changed everything. So when people write on this site about the power of networks, don't imagine a stock photo of a man in a suite shaking someone's hand. Think of picking up the phone and spending some time talking to someone. Make yourself a positive part of their life and you will be in their mind as opportunities arise. The more people you contact, the more opportunities will come your way. There is never a bad time to do this and there is no better use of your time if you're looking for work.

So if you're ever feeling like I felt, know this: There is an end in sight.",1521868396.0,2018-03-24 01:13:16

415,Just had an interview with the most socially awkward person I’ve ever met,453,azz9je,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/azz9je/just_had_an_interview_with_the_most_socially/,92,"This was akin to being on a bad date. Sitting at dinner before the meal has been served, knowing you have to fill at least an hour of awkward conversation EXCEPT THIS WAS FOR A PROFESSIONAL JOB AND WE ARE TWO GROWN ADULTS.

He was apparently going through the motions and not even considerate enough to even pretend to feign the slightest interest in my background, experience, why I was looking for a new job, what I did at my previous positions.

Interview started out with the most generic questions imaginable- like asking a Doctor to tell you what he knows about hearts.

Then I would answer in the way I figured would be most applicable to the position requirements (since the topic of the question was so broad) and then he would sit there and fill the room with this awkward silence. No follow up question, no indication that the answer was interesting or not to him.

In between questions I could almost see his brain working to think up a random question to ask me that was marginally applicable to our career field.

This goes on for twenty minutes to the point that I’m now carrying the conversation and voluntarily elaborating on the topics because I have no idea if he’s listening or comprehending anything I’m saying.

Finally get to the obligatory “So, do you have any questions for me?” from him.

I ask him to explain the position in more detail. He does. Turns out I have the EXACT same experience at my last job,  like I’m talking a 100% match for skills and experience.  I mention this assuming he had read my resume, which he then freely admits he hasn’t.

So he wraps up the interview by thanking me for my time and he’ll check out my resume like it’s my Facebook page or some piece of artwork I have up on Instagram because who reads someone’s resume before they call them on for an interview?

I swear this was so unprofessional that I wonder if I would have any benefit in contacting HR at his company and complaining? Or do I just move on.

416,Has anybody ever left a job with the feeling that they learned absolutely nothing?,453,d85ewi,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/d85ewi/has_anybody_ever_left_a_job_with_the_feeling_that/,89,"I'm thinking about leaving my first job out of college after a year, and can't help but shake the feeling that when I do - I'll be back at square one. Right where I started, with little to show for it.

I can't help but feel like I missed out on the typical route of progression normally associated with a career job: *get a job, get experience in the field, move up to a better job & salary...* and so on.

I took this job because I was at my wit's end. After almost a year of unemployment (with part time gigs here and there) I was willing to take quite literally anything. Unfortunately, it was essentially a bait and switch - my job title is quite inaccurate and the duties are just *weird -* a mix of account managing and doing grunt tasks that my coworkers are too skilled to do. There is little to no organisation and the whole place just feels chaotic; like it could burst apart at the seams at any moment.

To tell you the truth, I have loathed this job with every fibre of my being since day one. But I've forced myself to stick it out for 'experience' - the sad truth in the matter is that I feel like I haven't learned a thing. I honestly believe that if/when I leave, I have absolutely no idea where to go, or what to do next. I can't help but feel angry and upset that things have turned out this way and have been left disillusioned with how I thought working life would be after school.

Has anybody else ever felt this way? Spent a significant(ish) amount of time at a job, only to realise that it will get you nowhere in the grand scheme of things? It's really been hitting me hard lately and I'm finding it very difficult to even care about my role.",1569268106.0,2019-09-23 15:48:26

I stayed late at work for month-end. 

So I went into work today and talked to my boss nearly first thing in the morning. She and her boss (our corporate controller) had a closed door meeting with me. The meeting was essentially, ""We want to make sure this isn't going to escalate into anything more than it needs to be,"" IE., legal reprimands. 

Because I'm currently in a situation where I could receive a career changing promotion within the next 3-6 months *and* this is my first employer I've had in my current profession, I told her I did not have intentions to escalate the situation, and I mean that. I know you all wanted me to see a lawyer, but I enjoy my work and I like my company, so I meant what I said. I don't plan to sue. 

She did give me 1 week of extra PTO, the green light to take Christmas week off with it, 39 hours of OT, and her word that they will  be getting a new door installed in that hallway that will allow one-way exiting when the door is locked. (This was after I brought up the fire-hazard concerns that you all mentioned.) Quite honestly, it was a LOT more than I was expecting. 

I know you all say I could get a lot of money if I sue, but I feel like the $1000 of OT and a week of PTO is what that 39 hours was worth for my case in particular. I know it could have been a lot worse if it was someone else, but I really don't want to mess up my future employment because something else *could have happened*. 

I know it's not the outcome a lot of you wanted, but I'm happy with it. ",1441183557.0,2015-09-02 04:45:57

Sure enough, they called all of my references the same day. Signs were looking great the job was mine. The president of the nonprofit called me yesterday, just a few days later, and started off by saying we had a lot to talk about. She said my resume was one of the most impressive she'd seen, I gave a phenomenal interview, and I am very lucky to have my references as they all raved about me. 

She then switched gears to tell me she had made the difficult decision and offered the position to another candidate. I was pretty bummed, as I had tried my best and felt like I really impressed the committee. But, she gave me an offer to utilize her knowledge and connections in our field, even going so far as to list the organizations which she has contacts in who may be interested in me. She said she was making my job search a priority for her, and would be forwarding me more positions I may be suited for.

I got another email from her last night offering to send me to a rather expensive virtual leadership workshop, all expenses covered. Of course, I accepted, but I feel extremely confused as to why she would invest in me without just hiring me for the position. Does she know something I don't know?

419,"UPDATE: A year ago, I was the first-year teacher with the class from hell wishing for any other career.",450,eh1h2j,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/eh1h2j/update_a_year_ago_i_was_the_firstyear_teacher/,85,"Here is the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9gvjyo/im_a_first_year_teacher_i_have_the_class_from/). I posted asking for advice on other career paths, desperate to get out of teaching.

It's been a year and I can proudly say that I am no longer a teacher. I did manage to finish out the school year and I started my new, beautiful, wonderfully boring office job on June 3rd.

When I wrote that post, I was a 3rd grade teacher with the class from hell. Funnily enough, I got transferred AGAIN after that post. If you remember from the post, I started out as a 5th grade teacher and was doing very well. Then I was involuntarily transferred to the other school to teach the 3rd graders that made my life miserable. Not long after I wrote the post, I was involuntarily transferred back to the ORIGINAL school but to teach 2nd grade. Suffice it to say, I will never send my kids to that particular school district.

But I was happy to be transferred again in this case. My 2nd graders were much easier. But sadly, my relief didn't last.

I started having problems of a different sort. The administration at the original school turned out to be horrible and piled so much work on me. My 2nd grade team was awful as well. I started having breakdowns again but not because of my students. This time, it was because of the admin and my team putting so much pressure on me. There was so much work. I frequently worked 12 hour days, all of my Sundays, and some of my Saturdays JUST to tread water. And even then, I wasn't succeeding. I was berated and told that I needed to do more, that if it was really important to me, I'd make it happen.

When they said that to me, it was all I could do not to walk out on my students and just rage-quit in the middle of the day.

So starting in March, I applied to jobs. I applied to everything that paid at least 35k or more. Even customer based jobs that required a lot of talking on the phone. I was desperate.

I interviewed for my current job on April 1st. It was for a housing coordinator position in Atlanta. My job would be to find my clients temporary housing when they were displaced due to a fire, tornado, water damage, etc. I'd work with the insurance adjusters and the clients to find a short-term rental.

I wouldn't have to work overtime. I wouldn't be expected to work on the weekends or answer work emails when I'm home. I wouldn't have to deal with misbehaving kids, raise my voice on a near-daily basis, get sick all the time, cry, or deal with unrelenting admin and team members.

It sounded like heaven. In the middle of May during dismissal and attempting to herd the kids out of my classroom, my phone dinged. I took it out of my pocket and the email offering me the job appeared on the screen.

My students had no idea why I was suddenly so happy and grinning from ear to ear.

The best part was that they were offering me a 40k base salary plus commission. As a teacher, I made 35k. So 40k plus commission and a flat 40 hour workweek sounded incredible to me. Naturally, I accepted.

My last day ever of being a teacher was on May 24th. I started my new career on June 3rd.

About a month later, I received my captioned telephone at work and my fears of speaking on the phone to clients were assuaged.

Now 6 months later, I am still so incredibly happy with my career. Leaving teaching was the best thing I have ever done for myself. Not ONCE have I ever entertained the thought of going back to the classroom.

I have amazing bosses and coworkers. Some people might think my job is boring but I actually enjoy it! And the dress code in the office is very laid back. I get to wear jeans, tennis shoes, and a hoodie to work every day if I want.

I am doing very well at work too. At my 120 day review, my boss said I was doing fantastic and she couldn't really think of anything that I needed to improve on. It truly is amazing to have a boss that respects you and doesn't micro-manage you.

I don't know what I'll do in the future career-wise but I am content to stay here as long as I can and work my way up through the ranks. We are treated very well here and I have no desire to leave anytime soon.

I still technically teach online for VIPKid as a side gig for extra money but that is very different from an American brick and mortar classroom. Plus I don't do any prep work and I choose my own schedule. I teach ONE kid for 25 minutes at a time and most of the kids are very respectful. So in that sense, I guess I'm still a teacher.

But when people ask me if I miss teaching, I smile at them and say ""Absolutely not!""

I decided to post this update because I want people to know that if you are in a career that you hate and you feel stuck, don't lose hope. There IS a way out for you, you just have to find it. Life is too short to be miserable. And if you're doing some sort of public service job like teaching or healthcare, don't let people guilt you into staying.

My students deserved a better teacher than me. They deserved someone that actually wanted to be there. I have zero regrets about leaving and I am a much happier person for it.

If you're still searching for a job, don't give up! It's so hard but it's worth it in the end. Your future self will thank you. :)",1577622394.0,2019-12-29 07:26:34

Over the past 6-8 years since I started in the corporate world, my job has hung over my head like a gray cloud.  I no longer have the traits I feel I used to have - straight out of college I was bright-eyed, curious, driven, and most of all - content.  I have a brain fog that perverts my reality now - during nights and weekends (Sunday night especially) I just fantasize about vacation or even better, when I could potentially quit my job and have a couple weeks between the next one.  I'm not present in life, I just sort of stroll through it and react whereas I used to be a spontaneous guy planning all types of things.  It's not even the hours which can be long (I  work a second over 50-55 per week), it's just the feeling that I have to do this like Sisyphus over and over until I retire.  And I've even discovered FIRE, so my retirement age is closer to 50/55 rather than 65/70 like most people - I think that might make me feel worse about it, though.

Having been with 3 different companies in 8 different roles over 8 years, I've realized I just don't want this life and I'm not sure that coping is the right way to do it.  I'm not much of an entrepreneur type, either.  I've considered a couple options:

* Down-shift - take my 6-figure salary and accept a lower-paying job that I don't work home (physically or in my brain) on nights and weekends - I have a family and not sure this is a good option
* Double your coping efforts - I say I meditate, workout, yoga, etc - but I'm pretty inconsistent.  Maybe I need to double my efforts and really buckle down then I can cope with this life better.
* Try to start my own business - as I said above, I'm not really a creative type and I don't have a ton of experience with anything useful outside of IT and corporate audit (no one would hire me to be a consultant, trust me) - but maybe there's a niche I could see filling, who knows.

She also is, by definition, ""fluent"" in English, she just has trouble with the bigger words and complex ideas and sentence structures. I brought that up because I was expecting many to suggest a call center job, and I don't think that would be a good fit for her unless she works on her speaking abilities.

She is coming over on Sunday and I am going to explain to her that her job at Home Depot is currently a good set-up, and I will suggest if she wants better hours/pay/environment to look into similar stores (Lowes, Costco, maybe Whole Foods, etc.)

On top of that I will ask her more specifically about her history with programs such as MedicAid, human services, free community college classes (I know she took some before I was born in the early 90's), library classes, etc. Then I'll explain to her that if she wants a less straining job such as a call center or something with more computer work, that she will need to put the time into training herself to get better at her English and computer skills, and we will look into getting those resources together.

EDIT 2: because multiple people have asked, we both live in Minnesota in the Twin Cities Metro, about a 45 minute drive away from each other.",1580872955.0,2020-02-04 22:22:35
430,So I just got my first job ever and they didn't train me at all,445,kgs6hf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/kgs6hf/so_i_just_got_my_first_job_ever_and_they_didnt/,92,"I just started working at Target and I made sure they knew I had never worked before and I was very new to everything at my orientation. And I got a very very brief tour of the store but then the next day i had an eight hour shift first thing in the morning and first of all, I didn't even meet my manager. I asked this random girl for help because I had no clue what I was doing when I got there, and she kind of helped me fold clothes and remove empty hangers for a while. and then i had someone briefly show me the cash register and online orders as well (but not how to use them) and then I was just essentially told to do whatever. I am not at all confident and I feel like I need a bit more personal focus to understand what it is exactly i need to be doing. I dont need someone to hold my hand, but if I at least had a general idea of what tasks I need to get done, that would be helpful. Anyway, the confusion has caused me so much grief and stress already and its only been a couple days, I have the weekend off but going back gives me so much anxiety and dread, and I've cried every day since I started because I just genuinely have no clue whats going on and no clue who to ask. And I wish I could just not go back but I honestly don't know what to do. I had heard they treat their employees horribly but I didn't realize it would be like this. What do i do please

How was the response? How will it be perceived? 

I have an interview tomorrow with a very well known company that I had previously interviewed with eight months ago. The position is an entry-level assistant job at a Fortune 500 company. I went through four rounds of interviews, met everyone I would be working with, but unfortunately didn't get the offer in the end.  The HR emailed me, saying the position has opened up and the team remembered me and would like to interview me once again. 

However, since it has been such a short amount of time, I would like to know what happened? Was someone fired, promoted, or didn't mesh with the team? Is this a red flag?  I usually like to ask questions that look like I'm excited about the role and want to be successful with the company but I'm worried about looking like I'm skeptical about the job. Though if they remember me, they probably already know that I have the drive to be successful. 

I feel like if I go through the process of interviewing with them again they'll be comparing me to eight months ago. ""Is he as good as I remember or no?"" ""How has his success looked like these past few months?"" Things like that. What are some questions I should ask during the interview this time? What are things I should look out for by going through this process again?

Is quitting via email with no notice justified for me?,435,bkg2sa,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/bkg2sa/had_a_mental_breakdown_today_after_months_of/,217,"So I'm 24 and work part time as a sales assistant in clothing. I'm a student and am finished at the end of the year so I'm working part time retail gigs for pocket money. It started as a Christmas gig around November, but I worked my absolute butt off and about a month after I started, I was offered a management position. All the management treated me golden, praised me during meetings and wanted me in their 'circle'. I was flattered, but ultimately turned it down because I knew it was full time but I was still studying full time so I couldn't do it. I still stayed as a casual, and continued to put 100% in, work really hard and continue to prove myself as hard working and capable.

In the meantime, I heard that many of my coworkers took badly to me being offered management, and many created a private group chat where they belited and made fun of me and thought I didn't deserve the job. One of my friends at work heard about this through someone who was in the chat. None of them knew that before I went back to college, I actually had 2.5 years of management experience from my last job or obviously how hard I worked. Still, I brushed it off as jealousy and they don't know me and just went there to do my job and nothing more. Then out of nowhere about 2 months ago, shit just hit the fan. I had several coworkers report me to my boss for the most miniscule things. One reported me for talking ""too long"" to a customer when I asked her about her weekend plans when I was putting the sale through. Another reported me for using scissors instead of a box cutter (I asked another manager for one and they said there were out). Another for taking my break only TEN minutes after my scheduled time because I was closing a sale worth THREE thousand dollars. The list went on. 

Then, my boss turned against me suddenly, obviously believing all these people, and then finding her own little things to pull me up for. Then last month, my work introduced store credit cards to try to scam customers into signing up for one. They always existed, but I was never told during my interview or when I first started that it was mandatory to sell them. It's not mentioned in my contract or job description either. But still, the pressure to sell them became unreasonably high. You can't just pressure people to get a fucking credit card, we're a clothing store not a bank! My manager screamed at me in front of 5 of my other coworkers on the sales floor for not getting a card yet. She said I was pulling everyone else down and that everyone's sick of picking up my slack. I could see my coworkers smirking with glee behind her. 


Then, to replace the management job I was offered, they picked two of my other coworkers to be team leaders instead.  Both of these people are a lot younger, have zero management experience and this is their first and and only job. Still, I gaveth the benefit of the doubt and I respected them as my superiors. Immediately, they both went on a massive power trip and directed all their pulling up activities at me and only me. I found out that one of the new managers is actually the person that STARTED the group chat about me. So knowing that I had a manager who had a preexisting unjustified hatred towards me made me feel very unsafe and sick to go to work. Two weeks ago, I rock up to my shift and one of my team leaders asked to have a ""chat"" to me. I knew it was serious, and expected to go into a meeting room of some sort for privacy. No. She takes me to the stockroom where in eye and ear view of 10 other employees, begins to tell me that in July there are performance reviews and I'm one of the half a dozen or so who are looking at not keeping their jobs. She never explicitly said ""you'll be fired""  but she told me that I'm a ""grey area"" and ""sell a card or you won't be moving on with us"". I was shaken and told her I didn't understand. I told her I go above and beyond my sales targets, get nothing but praise from customers and other managers up until now. She told me ""don't talk back to me just do your job"" so I told her I'm really trying and will continue to. Instead of giving me the chance to be on the sales floor to actually sell one, I'm forced to spend my whole shift unpacking stock in the back. I realised then and there that my time was fast approaching an end there, and I should start applying for  other jobs.

Then they cut my shifts, and I didn't get one for almost two weeks. Then Thursday I had my first shift in that time, but still I kept positive and happy and went to work in a good mood and told myself I'd work hard and get a card. Not even five minutes into my shift, BOTH of the team leaders come up to me and both ask to see me privately. Again I'm thinking okay I'm either gonna be fired now or I'll be yelled at again. They take me again into the back room. Zero privacy or dignity and both of them gang up against me 2-1 with the same horse shit. I later found out via my country's union that having two managers against one person is not okay in HR standards but whatever. So they both begin with the same story. That I still haven't sold a card, that I'm dragging everyone else down and so on. I said to them I haven't been here for two weeks to get the chance to sell one. Then they both put on 'sweetheart' voices and say in a really bitchy way ""Well that's why you're here today...to get one"". Then the threats started. ""So you're still not looking good for the people that will be cut after June"", ""Our manager is currently interviewing for new staff"", and ""There's letters are currently being sent out to the people that won't be moving with us"". They didn't explicitly say ""and you're on the list"" but you get the jist. I told them again that I'm trying really really hard and selling a credit card isn't as easy as signing up to a mailing list but I will try.


I felt really bullied and defeated that they both went two against one publicly where lots of other staff saw. I still tried to hold my dignity and went back on to the floor with smiles even though I wanted to cry and throw up inside. I did really good with sales. Then..every twenty minutes yes twenty one of the team leaders would come up to me and only me to ask if I've gotten a card yet. When they both went on their breaks I used the opportunity to ask the seven other people on my team that night if out of curiosity they've gotten a card since they started pushing them. All but one said *nope*, I asked if they've had it mentioned it to them. Only *one* did and she said it was briefly mentioned at the start of their shift to get one if she could. That was my breaking point. I went on my break after that and bawled my eyes out in the bathroom cause I realised it was only me they were targeting and unfairly at that. So I come back and keep trying to get a card to no avail. Then about an hour before closing it was obviously dead quiet and I accepted that I'll be lucky if I serve one person so how the hell am I gonna get a card. Then one of my team leaders came up to me and instructed me to stand in another section where it might get busier to sell a card. I happily obliged with a continued smile on my face. Not a single person came in to that section, but I did what I was told and stood there anyway. I realised about fifteen minutes before closing that I still need to tidy up my department's section and went back over to do it. I raced around the racks finger spacing it and making it look pretty when my team leader came up to me. 

She put on a ""sweetheart"" voice but I could hear the bitchy undertones. She asked me how I found my shift today. I told her that while I'm naturally disappointed I didn't sign up a card, I did very well with sales. She smacked her lips and said ""right...it's just that I just couldn't help but notice now that you're looking incredibly sad and mopey and it's not a good look"". I actually laughed and said to her ""sorry? I've been nothing but smiles the whole day, I've been expressionless yes while I'm tidying up the racks but why would I be smiling at the racks I'm tidying up?"" She pursed her lips and goes ""right well it's just not a good look and something to take on board"". I said to her okay I will..? But it doesn't stop there. She then continued to say ""I also can't help but notice that you're tidying the racks up now but it's something that should've been done an hour ago"". I told her that I would've, but you specifically asked me to spend the last hour in another section to try and get a card, which I **did** so how could I do both at once? She pursed her lips again and just said ""anyway thanks for the day we're closed now so you can go home"". So I'm certain that she'll spin this and tell our boss that I'm sad and mopey, that I don't tidy up, whatever she can spin to make me look bad.


I left and cried walking to the train station. I cried on the train and then when I got home I basically had a big fat breakdown to my parents and brother. They were all gob smacked and told me that this is bullying and threatening and should quit. Now. I have a tonne of savings from working during Christmas and I still live at home and study full time anyway so it's fine for me to be suddenly unemployed I know I can find another part time retail job soon. But I don't know how to quit. I would like to mention that I also get really bad anxiety. It was under control for a while, but this last two weeks I've hyperventilated and had panic attacks on the daily. It should be easy for me to just call my boss and tell her I'm done except for me it's kind of not. My brain just can't do it. So then my friend said well fuck it if they don't give a shit about you, don't give a shit about them email your boss and just do it like that. I don't know what else to do. I know that going in to quit will lead to me breaking down, crying or letting it all out and I just can't mentally handle it anxiety wise. My next shift isn't until this coming thursday, and it's for three hours (I was getting 3x7 hour shifts a week) only so as you can see, I'm being cut out already. So if I was to email my boss today, she'd surely see it by Monday. My brother works in a building a block over and offered to go in and give my badge and staff card back if they request it. I know two people who quit by email with little to no notice, and neither of them even got a reply back from my boss. I only know one person who quit in advance with two weeks notice, and she was forced to fill out some resignation form. Surely they can't make me do the same? I'm a casual. I don't really care about ""bridges being burned"" because my reference is from my previous assistant manager who left during my ""peak"" there and we're FB friends and all that and always told me I'm welcome to use her as a reference. 


But I don't know what else to do, I mentally cannot deal. I've slept 3-4 hours every night the last two weeks, barely eat either, have panic attacks and cry everyday. Please help me.

451,The 3 day weekend,438,aod6pj,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/aod6pj/the_3_day_weekend/,137,Just wanted to give my opinion on an important topic. I currently work a job where I work Tuesday-Friday from 8am-6pm with paid lunches and I also get 3 days off each week. I have never had a job before that allows this and I think all companies if possible should allow all employees to have 3 days off per week. I don't feel nearly as tired and drained when it's time to go back to work with this schedule compared to the traditional Monday-Friday schedule. I also don't feel like one of my off days when working the traditional schedule is more or less spent on getting ready for the week and running errands leaving me with only one day to myself. I think employers would get a better performance from all workers by giving employees more time to themselves on a more consistent basis. What do yall think? ,1549631526.0,2019-02-08 08:12:06
452,"I just got a great new job, because 3 weeks ago I met a guy in a bar. I wasn't even actively looking for work.

I went to a bar in my neighborhood for lunch and a couple beers. It's a small place, but has gotten really trendy recently so has a large and diverse customer base. 

So I'm eating lunch by myself at the bar, and this sort of drunk guy starts talking to me. Kind of obnoxious but I figured I could use the company so we start making small talk. But this too-drunk-for-2:00PM guy happens to be there with a friend of his who seems normal enough, so I mostly end up chatting with the friend. I explained that I was taking an afternoon off because my job was wearing me down lately. He asked what I did for a living. He then explained that he happened to be a 3rd party recruiter in my industry, and that he had an out of town client who had recently landed quite a bit of work in our region and was trying to get someone local onboard to manage it. We traded business cards, changed the subject, and I figured that was the end of it.

A few days later he called me to see when I would be a available for a phone interview with his client. A few days after that I slipped out of work on my lunch break and had a half hour phone interview that went really well. A week after that I was on the road driving 3-1/2 hours to headquarters to interview with the regional manager and VP. Today I got a formal offer letter. 20k+ pay raise, solid benefits package and a huge step up career wise. It's a well regarded national company and the Glassdoor reviews are generally good.

**If You Didn't Get the Job, That Doesn't Mean You Failed**

As job applicants, we often perceive a lack of a job offer as a failure of our performance during the vetting process.  It's reasonable to come to this conclusion, because we often attribute outcomes directly to performance.  In some cases, this may be 100% true.  However, there are literally hundreds, if not thousands, of data points and decisions in the algorithm tree that factor into a hiring decision.  Your resume didn't pass the ATS test.  Your salary requirements were too low or too high.  They chose an internal candidate who already has rapport with the team.  Someone else had niche experience from a previous role that you did not. The list of factors for why you didn't get a position is incredibly vast and often outside your control.

Consider this brief anecdote.  I recently worked with a highly ambitious and well-spoken 20-something who I imagine will be wildly successful over the course of his career.  While working with him, he had confided in me that he was interviewing for another position that would be in a more ideal location.  His wife also has a career in HR, so he was being coached on every facet throughout this process.  He showed up to the interview and presented a portfolio of work.  In our line of work, this is very much going *above and beyond*.  The day after the interview, he hand-delivered hand written letters to the staff.  Again, this is relatively *above and beyond*, but he was highly motivated to get this job.  He waited weeks before hearing back, and I encouraged him that this was normal for government agencies to drag their feet during the hiring process.  When he finally heard back, he was informed that they had ultimately decided to go with a candidate who happened to have experience in an enterprise software package that he did not have.

My former colleague's story represents a perfect example of someone who didn't *fail* to get the job. He merely lost out to factors that were completely outside of his control.  In most cases, this is what's happening to us during the job searching process when we don't get the job.    

**Most Organizations Are Inherently Chaotic** (aka ""toxic"")

Imagine putting hundreds, if not thousands, of people with unique personality traits, goals, ambition, values, and intelligence together for a common purpose of carrying out an entire organization's aspirations. Enter just about every workplace in the world.  What could possibly go wrong?

I often hear the term ""toxic"" thrown out to describe why an individual is seeking an escape from their workplace.  And this really got me thinking.  Is it true?  Can so many organizations be this awful?  After a long time ruminating on this, I think the answer is *Yeah, kinda*.  This isn't a knock on corporate culture specifically.  It's recognition of the reality of what happens when you put so many different, unique people together in one place to achieve a common goal.  There *will be* disputes.  There *will be* misunderstandings.  There *will be* drama.  And there's literally nothing you can do about it.

Well, sort of.  I think the best way to deal with most difficult situations is to acknowledge that it exists and confront it head on.  When you're confronting it head on, this doesn't mean you dress down the individual(s) who is causing you dissatisfaction; you need to be tactful, empathetic, and (most importantly) learn how to just not care so much.  

While I realize that some places are indeed worse than others, there will always be things that bother you in the workplace.  One of the most important things I learned from this recent experience is that work is just like any other relationship.  Happiness in relationships is fundamentally based on finding those that contribute a healthy ratio of satisfaction:dissatisfaction to your life.  No one is perfect, and no workplace is perfect.  Find those workplaces that give you the right balance of satisfaction to dissatisfaction.  

**Patience (And Perseverance) Is Indeed Virtuous**

Twelve years ago, I moved across country with most everything I owned jam-packed into my car.  It was 2008, I just finished college with a ""worthless"" degree (or so they told me), I had only a few years of irrelevant work experience, and landed smack-dab in the middle of one of the worst recessions in history.  I didn't know anyone here.  I didn't have a job lined up.  I lived out of a Motel 6 and my credit card balance was nearing $5k.  This was quite terrifying at the time as I had not a cent to my name and $50k of student loan debt that was nearing the end of its deferment.  I could have given up on this adventure rather quickly, but I wanted to succeed so badly.  

So I hustled harder than I've ever hustled before.  I called up every recruiting agency in town and interviewed with them.  I networked with anyone I encountered; at the bar, on the street, wherever, whenever, and however it could be done.  I landed some temp work to pay the bills while I continued applying for jobs.  And finally it came in the form of a $14/hr + benefits job in a field I knew nothing about.  It was only $2/hr more than what I was making in college, but it was all I needed to anchor myself.  The day I received my first ever job offer post-undergrad, I signed a lease on a 500 square foot studio apartment.  It was one of the happiest, most fulfilling days of my young life.

Three years later, I got another job which included a meager $2k pay bump.  I was dumb and naive then and hadn't realized the art of negotiation.  Another three years down the road, I learned from my mistakes and negotiated a $10k pay bump for a new position.  Two years flew by, and I moved into a new role, in a new industry, and earned another sizable bump.  A couple positions later, and I've managed to work myself up to a salary nearly 300% above where I started 12 years ago.  

The point here is that progress happens in due time and with due effort.  A lot of people you see today who have posh, lucrative jobs did not just fall and trip into it on day one.  What you're typically seeing is the result of years of effort, exploration, failures, and successes.  There is no magic formula or algorithm for how one gets to that result, which I often see people on here asking for.  There are only things that you can try out to see what works, but you have to be willing to try first and foremost.  You have to be willing to allow things to develop over time. And perhaps the most important take away here is that you have to be willing to persevere in the face of adversity, because there will be so, so very much of it.

**Advocate For Yourself or No One Will**

Most companies will take advantage of you to the fullest extent they can.  While this may seem rather obvious, here is why I bring it up.  Most things in life are negotiable, even when *they* say it's not.  Therefore, you should spend time learning how to effectively advocate for yourself.  If you don't, then your employer may find every way imaginable to exploit you to the fullest extent they can within the law.  

Now, there will be people who say that this is nonsense; that you should fall in line and shut up if you know what's good for you.  But these people either A) have a vested interest in your unwavering compliance (i.e. the exploiters), or B) haven't the courage to stand up for themselves no matter the situation.  The latter type of person prefers short term stability and security no matter the cost to them, their families, or their long term health. They view it as a strength; I view it as a weakness for allowing fear to dictate their actions.

In full disclosure, I have had a job offer rescinded for trying to negotiate.  And I would also attribute losing my most recent job to trying to self-advocate for additional support when I needed it.  However, I can counter-argue that why would anyone wish to work for a company that doesn't even entertain the idea of negotiation on the front end?  What does that mean for you once you start working for them and need something down the road?  As for my current situation, my former employer has a long history of screwing their employees over.  I know of several people who've been screwed out of commissions they were promised prior to a deal closing.  I know of people who've been lied to about what their role was to be, or what it was to eventually become.  The laundry list of ways my former employer has taken advantage of their trusting employees is extensive.

I lost my job and everything that comes with it because I opted to advocate for myself.  But it's not the end of the world.  They offered me severance pay, health insurance, unemployment, and glowing references in exchange for me to go away and stop pestering them with requests for a more supportive work environment.  Combined with my nest egg that will take me well into next year on its own, I'd argue that I came out pretty, pretty good here. 

**Find Yourself Before It's Too Late**

There is absolutely no shame in moving around in your career to figure out what best suits you.  You have your entire life to work.  So take several opportunities to explore different career paths.  The days of sticking with a company long term mostly died along with pension plans.  With the mobility of 401ks, access to countless job boards, and the ease of moving across state lines or working remotely, people are no longer confined to their local job markets or employers long term. 

In addition to taking opportunities to find a suitable and rewarding career path, some of your biggest pay raises will come from jumping ship.  Remember when I told you that your employer will take advantage of you to the fullest extent?  Well, that includes your compensation package.  In most cases, once they've signed you on to your current role, there is rarely a plan to fast track you to a better position and better salary.  They've locked you in right where they want you and they have every intention of keeping you there for as long as they can, and at the lowest compensation that you will tolerate.

There will always be exceptions to any rule.  Some companies/industries are required to spend a lot of resources to onboard new talent and expect it to stick around for awhile.  But most people aren't privy to jobs in those types of companies/industries because they lack the necessary, and often times, rigorously-acquired credentials.  Therefore, those exceptions are not likely to apply to your situation.  

**Last, But Not Least, Don't Sweat It**

Very few people on their death beds, in their last waking moments, have an epiphany about how they wish they had worked longer and harder for someone else.  Actually, it's quite the opposite.  Most people on their death beds regret not having spent more time with their families or on hobbies and interests or traveling the world.  I spent two and a half years grinding away at a job, stressing out over not feeling prepared, and within a week after my departure they have completely forgotten about me and everything I contributed to the team.

No former job, former manager, or former colleague has ever had a significant impact on my future outcomes.  While it seems like somewhere you've spent 40+ hours a week over several years would have a lasting impact on your life, it mostly doesn't.  It'll probably take you less than a few weeks to be completely over it and removed from that situation altogether.  So the next time you're feeling the overwhelming weight of the job, client needs, or management's demands, remember that none of it really matters and it will just as well be forgotten the day after you've walked out the door for the final time.",1599608016.0,2020-09-08 19:33:36

I was told my “services were no longer needed” about 18 months ago. Today, I received a DM from the individual that is currently in my former role, asking to “pick my brain.” What’s the best way to respond?

Backstory: I left a 10+ year marketing job to join a new industry and I loved every waking moment of the job. About 1 year into the role, my supervisor/mentor left for a new job and within a month’s time, a toxic co-worker made it her mission to destroy me. The drama that ensued is beyond my own comprehension at this point, but ultimately, I started seeing a counselor, started questioning my own sanity, got on Zoloft and within 6 months, I was meeting with HR (whom she’d groomed and ultimately conspired with) and my job was terminated. I should mention, prior to her involvement in my employment, the CEO regularly praised my performance - I was not fired because of anything I was doing wrong. I was fired because she didn’t like me. In hindsight, it was the best thing that has ever happened to me - I completed an industry certification (already funded by my former employer) and landed the same dream job with another employer - and I do it from home now for nearly twice the salary. A week after I left, I received a text message from a former coworker asking for help, which I simply decided to ignore. Fast forward to a year and a half later - today. I received an invitation to connect on LinkedIn with a message from my replacement saying they’ve “heard only great things” about me and asking to pick my brain. I know how I want to respond. But I also know that how I want to respond is not professional and this person had nothing to do with anything that happened in the past. My guess is that they are in a similar position as I was and this is a desperate attempt to save their job. So tell me, how should I respond? How can I politely tell this person that, nothing personal, but my best advice would be to run for the hills and that I have no desire to help my former employer be successful?",1591704735.0,2020-06-09 08:12:15

Early in my job search, I found the job title I was looking for at a company that seemed to be a great match for my experience. Unfortunately, my resume and cover letter skills were extremely rusty and my application was probably quite weak. I heard nothing back. 

A couple months later, I saw the position was still open, and by then I had gotten a lot better at writing application materials, and I still really wanted to work there. I hunted down the email address of the department head and sent him an email saying that I was still very interested in the position and that I had attached a resume and cover letter that I thought better highlighted my qualifications for this position. I never got a response, so I followed up a couple weeks later. 

I never did hear back from him, but I was contacted by someone else in the department who had received my resume from him, and reached out to see if I would be interested in interviewing for a different position. I ended up getting an offer after a couple interviews!

I guess there are a few takeaways here:
1. You CAN recover from a weak application. 
2. Directly emailing applications, practiced judiciously, can be effective. 
3. If you’ve got what a company wants, they will find a place for you.

VP level role, more than double my previous salary, multiple bonuses, and a complete relocation package. So long east coast winters, I'm moving to California!

It’s been quite a journey and I'd like to share my thoughts, tips, and tricks that worked for me. Take them for what you will.

* Keep detailed records of every application you make. This includes saving a copy of every resume and cover letter you submit for every role, so if you get a call back you know precisely what they are looking at. 

* Don't just relentlessly spam applications. I started off doing this, and found I was getting lackluster responses, I wasn't energized about any of the roles, and when one turned into an offer I turned it down to not being a good fit. Take the time to apply to jobs you want. Take the time to put effort into every single resume and cover letter, customizing each one for the relevant job you want. 

* Don't settle. Unless your bank account is $0 and your rent is due, don't just go out and snap up the first offer you get. Make sure you like the job, the role, the company, and the culture. Taking a crappy job is going to make you miserable, and not performing well, which makes the company not value you, and sets up all sorts of negative and antagonistic situations that almost never end well. If you have any kind of safety net, take the time to find the job you want. This is your life, and every hour you spend doing something you hate is an hour you will never get back. This was my fourth offer, and I'm glad I took the time to find it. 

* Attitude matters. A LOT. Don't approach a job hunt as some elaborate game where your job is to try and outwit or trick a company into hiring you. Things like lying on your resume, inflating/hiding salary information, setting up fake PO boxes and Google Voice numbers, that's all a bunch of childish nonsense. Employment should be a symbiotic relationship, where both sides benefit. Not a parasitic one where one side leeches off the other. Having that attitude will come across in interviews, and recruiters can see through the BS pretty easily. You are much better off acting in an honest, upfront, friendly and helpful manner than a deceitful, obfuscating, deceptive one. Stay positive, the more positive you are, the better you will represent yourself to recruiters.  

* Use Linkedin to contact recruiters directly. The job I ended up getting wasn't even posted, I had applied for a similar role, contacted the recruiter on LinkedIn and introduced myself, and on seeing my resume she replied asking me if I would be interested in this other role as well, I agreed, and was presented directly to the hiring manager, and went through the process and landed the gig. I likely would never have heard of the job if I hadn't taken the time to reach out to that recruiter and message them personally. 

* When looking for jobs out of state, what I found worked best for me was: Only apply to out of state jobs that specifically mention relocation as being offered, target jobs in the industry/sector you have experience in, and target higher level jobs that are harder to fill locally. 

* Practice your interview skills. Google the most likely questions recruiters will ask, and have your answers prepared. Give that list to friends and family and ask them to run you through a mock interview. Record yourself doing it, then watch the video afterwards. Ask them to give you a mock phone interview, record it, and listen back later taking note of how many ""umm's"" and how much dead air there was, did the conversation flow naturally, what the speed of your voice to fast, was your tone a pleasant one? Interviewing is a pretty unnatural experience, so you need to practice it. 

* If you aren’t having success, don't blame things outside yourself. It’s not only useless, but self defeating. Don’t fall into the trap of “I’m not getting any traction cause of nepotism, or I’m not getting calls because my last job had XYZ title, or my zip code is getting in the way, blah blah blah”. It’s a self defeatist attitude to have. There will always be things outside your control in every situation, focusing on them takes your attention away from the things you can control. Focus on your resume, your cover letter, your interview skills, things you can work manage and work with. 

* Don't let others get you down. One thing that surprised me was how many just downright mean and negative people there are in the job hunting world. They will try and put you down, dismiss your success, and inflict their anger at their situation on you. Don't let them. Looking for a job is rough enough, you don't need constant sources of pessimism and negativity bringing you down as well. Recognize them for what they are, people who are upset/sad/angry at their personal circumstances and their only coping mechanism is to try and project that on other people. Don't let them. Ignore them, and surround yourself with positive, motivational people and thoughts. It is their choice to stand in the muck, it's your choice not to join them.


That's pretty much it for advice, it's what worked for me, so take it as you will. I'm off to pick up some boxes and packing tape. Good luck to all the job seekers out there! Stay positive!",1467753945.0,2016-07-05 17:25:45
466,I finally found a job!,430,j80jx5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/j80jx5/i_finally_found_a_job/,63,"Finally, it has been a long process, after months of looking, I finally got an offer and it’s way above my expectations. 3 weeks of PTO, all base and incentives amount to above avg pay. I’m very grateful! I only had like two companies that reached out and this is one of them. I had more trouble getting an interview than with the interview itself (this has always been the case for some reason). And it had been a struggle with the job search...

I started with a staffing agency, they recommended many jobs but the location was either too far or for some reason there’s a long communication between all parties. The back and forth was just too long. And most of the time they were tiny companies. So I eventually started looking online thru indeed, Glassdoor (this is the best) and etc. I only applied to what seemed like a fit. Some people say just apply as many as possible, and that will increase your chances - I disagree. Instead of spending time on those that probably won’t get back to you, I would rather do something else. But of course that might not always be the case. 
Often times i would get rejected one day later (probably bot?) then I see that job gets reposted again and again. Or maybe I’m under qualified or overqualified , or my resume in general isn’t good.

Anyways, I’m just glad I have a job now. And I wish everyone else good luck with theirs as well!

EDIT: just some things that I personally felt like were big takeaways during this period: always interview with professionalism, be calm but not dead, laugh but not obnoxiously, and be interested! Give examples!
Don’t give you salary range right upfront ( big no no). Throw the ball in their court. 
Send thank you letters. And also, don’t get greedy with salary negotiation unless you have good reasons. I felt like I screwed that up a little and hurt the impression.
Anyways, while our job nature differs, I think most interview processes are similar one way or another. And it’s a hard process, I was stressed out , felt deterred, and gave up along the way. Even now, I’m nervous about not meeting expectations of this role. But we do what we can right?

I actually haven't been feeling so well lately and don't have insurance so going to a doctor is not an option.

Earlier today my boss had a chat with me about a project id been working on which turned out to have a big mistake on it.

Then while I was working on another project I noticed a mistake on that. I'm supposed to review this other project with him in a few hours but it's not ready and he wants to begin production tomorrow.

So I figured I'm probably not gonna last here (been here about 2 months almost) and so I went and looked around in Craigslist only to find out he hes hiring for my exact job title. Mind you there's no need for a second person to do what I do here, in fact his plan is to have only 1 person do it at least for the foreseeable future.

So yeah, I'm either getting fired or quitting very soon.

Comments are welcome, maybe there's a lesson to be learned here, but I also wanted to vent a little mainly coz now I'm super stressed about the project were supposed to review today.


9/5/19 Edit:

Tl;Dr: My edit was supposed to respond to the comments about what Ive learned but it got wayyy to long so heres a summary:

While I do think I can improve my existing skills as a design engineer (12 years now) I dont think I can enter the next plateau without expanding into a new field where I both learn a new skill set but also learn to apply my existing skills into that field. Ive been thinking about entering software development for some time, but I think my whole life ive never really been good at evaluating my own self worth. I think most if not all of my career choices were driven by a rationale of ""accepting what is offered to me"" rather than ""seeking what I really want"". I think i never prioritized my feelings or motivations, and when I chose to become an engineer at first I did it because I wanted to pursue my passion ""inventions, science, and technology"". But I quickly began working for others and always repeated the same mistake: find a job to pay bills because i need money. I never went out seeking work that met the conditions I preferred or happened in the manner I chose. I never prioritized my ability to choose. And thats the issue, so far ive learned 2 things from this experience: to improve my mistakes as an employee and increase my performance I need to learn new skills, but to prevent myself from having poor working experiences such as this one (and others I had in the past) I need to prioritize my ability to choose. I dont want to be managed, I want to choose what I do and how I do it. I want the work I do to be fulfilling and meaningful, but thats never going to happen if everytime I apply for a job I disregard my true motivations and emotions. So Ive decided Im quiting this job tomorrow, probably by email, not gonna prank them or mess with their job ad (though I admit those ideas were super funny), and Im not gonna engage in any further discussions with my boss since he only resorts to screaming and condescension. That said, I am already looking up jobs as a software developer, but I think I need to find opportunities where Im given alot of freedom, or where they hire me as a business. I currently own an LLC but it doesnt make money, its a brand new company I opened up recently because I had already figured out I wanted to choose what work I do and not be managed, but since I need to earn income I didnt prioritize those feelings. Before I send my resume out to anyone, first thing im gonna do is rewrite it so that anyone reading it understands my self worth. Any job decisions I make moving forward are gonna be based on that so that I dont repeat my mistakes. I will learn the skills for software development (i started learning programming back in april this year), but my goal isnt to become a software developer or abandon design engineering, my goal is to innovate and develop new technology. Thanks for all the support..


Here is the full edit:
first off wow I did not expect to see the support or all the advice Ive read here, so to everyone thank you for taking the time to hear out a lonelyneuron's job issues.

Also although I think it is seriously funny, Ive decided to pass on all the suggestions to apply for the job post (even the suggestion about using a fake name). I hope you all understand.

That said,

1. Today I decided to call in sick again, but this time I just really did not feel comfortable going in to work at this place anymore. I wanted the opportunity to decide what Id do and really think things through but I know 2 things: 

a. Theyre gonna fire me (probably tomorrow or very early next week, they havent said it but theyre behavior is clearly indicating that this is gonna happen)

b. I really dont want to be there anymore. A couple weeks ago there was an issue with a project and somehow the discussion involved me and when I gave my opinion the boss said ""what you think doesnt matter"". Honestly that just hurts to actually hear it. Ive never expected most of my bosses to care about what I think (more on this in a sec) but I definitely did not feel good hearing it. After that happened the mistakes I mentioned on my post happened along with a ""communication glitch which I had not mentioned"" and theyre approach was to condescendingly handwrite instructions and tape them to the wall telling me how to do my job and scream at me about my mistakes. Yesterday I talked with my boss for about 30 minutes and thats all he did: scream. When he stopped screaming he walked out. I was owning up to my mistakes and pointing out what I thought Id done wrong, what I thought the causes were, how id approach them to improve and then I also asked questions about priorities and deadlines. He didnt address any of my comments, in fact just outright dismissed them and said that I didnt have to worry about priorities and deadlines (which was the same thing he said every other time I asked about that).

2. All that said, Im done. Both because I know im being fired very soon (they didnt say that yet) but also because I know I dont want to continue this nonesense. Tomorrow ill quit, i havent decided if ill do it by email or in person, because frankly I just dont want to deal with them anymore but im quiting for sure.

3. I dont have another job waiting for me, I dont think I have much time or opportunity to fix this or find something else before im fired. I know they dont have an HR department, paid time off, or benefits, and I know ive only been there about 2 months, so it is unlikely Ill get unemployment benefits and if I wait to be fired itll be even less likely ill get it because perhaps I wouldnt qualify due to being fired but I doubt that I can get it with just 2 months or less of employment.

4. On the matter of my poor performance. I a drafter/mechanical design engineer/waterjet programmer (or just a design engineer). Ive been doing this work for a long time (12 years now) and I know how to do my work, ive done it successfully before. Though certain criteria did help me succeed, for example: clearly defined schedules, timelines, budgets, project goals, and priorities. I also benefited greatly from stable long term work that didnt involve multitasking. Ive never had an issue with doing alot of work, having multiple responsibilities, or working late. Ive always known that learning new skills is imperative to maintain peak performance. Specifically, as a design engineer, understanding how something is made is just as important as understanding why it is being made. But at this point, while I believe I could continue to learn new things, I dont think that I can improve my performance unless I branch out to a new career path. I think I need an entirely new skillset for an entirely different profession. 

5. I never went into engineering to work for other people. My motivations for it were simple: I love science and technology and wanted to make inventions and new things, useful things. But somehow either i didnt have the confidence or didnt value myself enough to really prioritize that, and while in the beginning learning by working for others was probably an ok choice, but honestly that wasnt why I did it. I never ever thought that I could actually pursue my passions and do what I wanted. Maybe its the way I was brought up, but I dont see the utility in blaming others for my issues. The point here is that I never thought I could do what I really wanted  (to the extent of accepting that its ok for my boss to not respect my opinion and say that it doesnt matter) so I thought id do whatever I could to start out then when i had enough money pursue my own projects. But in 12 years thats never happened. I think its time to change that.

6. I think this whole situation is a huge lesson for me. Both in reading the comments here as well as stories posted by other users Ive learned alot from this, but 2 things stand out:

a. poor performance is not entirely determined by lack of skill or experience. circumstances, stress, happiness levels, commuting times, poor communication, the feeling of impending doom, a boss that doesnt respect your opinion, dead end meaningless work, all can add up to poor performance. Anything that drains or lowers my motivation can quite easily lead to poor performance. Especially if Im already bad at understanding my own self worth and intrinsic human value. I think my poor performance in this case was affected by a number of these factors as well as my own personal lack of self worth. I went out looking for a job because I was desperate my bills were all behind i was drowning in debt. I didnt think about what I wanted or what feelings I had, I just needed a job and so I got one. This job couldve been a great job, for someone who wanted it. Not for me, I dont want to do what I am doing or do it in the conditions Ive been doing it. I think by choosing a career path where I subordinate myself while doing so with poor self worth, ive messed up my own opportunities for growth and improvement. Ive sabotaged myself.

b. getting a job that I want, shouldnt be something I think cant or wont happen. Regardless of the circumstances im in, I should start prioritizing how I feel about my work. Ive known for a long time that I want the freedom to choose what I do and how I do it. I dont want to be micromanaged, I dont want to be managed at all. I dont want to do the work someone else choose for me, in the manner they choose, at the time they choose, for the value they choose. I want to choose.

7. Ive been looking at jobs in a related but totally separate field where I have no experience and very little skill: software development. I think learning those skills would immensely improve my skills as a design engineer, but also my design engineering background could bring alot of potential value to a company that would hire me to develop software. However without the skill or expertiese, and considering I dont want to be managed, I think I need to find a way to be hired as a business and work with a team I manage. I really dont have it in me to think I can do this or succeed at this, but I think its what I need to do. Somehow I need to believe I can do it. I dont believe I can but I need to change that mindset in me. When I make this change I believe ill find a job that I want.",1567647758.0,2019-09-04 21:42:38
469,I Just Put in My Notice,425,92yezq,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/92yezq/i_just_put_in_my_notice/,99,"Been at job for 6yrs with “stellar” performance reviews. For three years I’ve been expressing my interest in moving up and dissatisfaction of no vertical growth. In Jan, had conversation with boss that my role in company is something to keep on the radar.

I started school again for MBA, all A’s in first semester. About to start second semester and thought, life’s short. I’m not getting anywhere with current job, I’ve been “hanging in there, we’d like to promote you,” for three years now. 

I’m done hanging in there. I quit.

EDIT:  So had meeting with boss. Noticeably boss was upset but respectful of choice, but said I was impatient and essentially said I shouldn’t ask for promotion just because I think I deserve it. Asked if I needed anything. I said no. Next step is to make sure all incoming and in progress projects are taken care of.  That’s why I gave more than a standard notice, very generous notice, actually. 

Then I notified the external people that would be affected with my departure. Many have contacted me, and I already have meetings with three of them this week.  I’m not even looking and they’re lined up to see me. It’s a testament to my work ethic and impact in the community. I feel so humbled :)",1532930218.0,2018-07-30 01:56:58

I had no idea I would get so many responses. I have a lot to think about but I think the majority was to put on a brave face and stick out the 2 weeks. (Considering the holiday, it would have been technically 9 days notice I gave, but it's a moot point now.) I do intend to do that as James has a lot of connections all over the country. I think that my place knows what kind of a scheming narcissist he is so in a way, the ""Apple"" executive was giving me sound advice- just do what he wants, we'll be here for you when you're all done. I hate to play along with his little mind games and theatrics, but as long as he acts this, it actually proves to me that I won in the end. He's throwing a tantrum because he can't control me anymore.

EDIT2: I should also mention I didn't tell him the new place where I was going. The executive at my new company let it slip by saying something like, ""And I hear Cautious\_bat is joining us next year!"" and James found out that way. 

Yep. I had to work for an insane, toxic manager who I'll call James and I finally found a great new job. As this is the holiday season, I intended to leave my old company on January 4th, even though it is technically not 2 weeks' notice from when I gave my formal resignation letter.

James knows an executive at my company and James complained to him that I am not giving enough time to wrap up my work. (Which is a lie- I've been wrapping up my work for weeks now quietly.) James sent me an email back saying, ""Hey, I would like it if you stayed for a full 2 weeks. As you know, I know a lot of people at ""Apple"" and it would be great if you wrapped up all your work before you left."" Then the ""Apple"" executive also sent me an email saying, ""Hey, it's totally okay if you need more time to give notice your company. Your start date is not a big deal, we are flexible!""

I have no choice right? I have no absolutely no choice but to stay 2 weeks to do god knows what he plans on making me do. And yes, he intentionally makes me do menial tasks as ""punishment"" such as fetching him coffee and snacks to his desk. He humiliates me on purpose because he knows he can and I am sure he will do it again now.

I don't want to burn bridges with him, and I obviously do not want to make a bad impression on my new company. Do I handle this the way he wants (2 full weeks) or is it better if I stand my ground now and say I will not stay past January 4?",1546329887.0,2019-01-01 03:04:47

482,Looking and applying for jobs on LinkedIn is awful and unnecessary.,415,duf5aj,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/duf5aj/looking_and_applying_for_jobs_on_linkedin_is/,131,"
Just to start, I want to point out that the concept of applying for jobs through LinkedIn is absolutely brilliant, having all your up to date credentials, achievements, prospects, skills and achievements all in one place for a potential employer to look through quickly and easily to determine if you'd be a great fit for a position you applied to! 

Only it doesn't happen that way most of, if not any time...

Here's a scenario that me and a lot of people I know have had when applying for jobs through LinkedIn:

1) Taking the time to update your LinkedIn profile to include all recently gained skills and credentials, readying it for job hunting!

2) Look up all available jobs on LinkedIn after sorting through all appropriate filters including location, entry level, etc...

3) See a huge list of potential jobs that you think youd be perfect for, so you click apply on one that appeals to you!

4) Takes you out of LinkedIn to another job advertising website or the job on the job posters careers page, where you have to click apply again!

5) Sign up to this job advertising website/company careers page with your e-mail address, a username, and a password!

6) Realise you have to fill out every single detail of your career, credentials, skills, achievements, etc that you spent time and effort all updating on your LinkedIn profile, then uploading a resumè/CV & cover letter, and submit it!

7) Repeat steps 3 to 6 for however many times you want to apply to a job through LinkedIn!

Has anyone else ever had to experience this and become frustrated with how monotonous and time consuming it is? I feel like having all your credentials and achievements on LinkedIn is completely useless when you have to enter all the same information again and again and again when applying for jobs! Not to mention all the e-mails clogging up your inbox with job alerts from every single job advertising website you had signed up for, then spending even more time having to log in to these websites to manually turn them off...its just so broken! 

Why can't companies post job adverts solely through LinkedIn? I'm not sure how job posting works on LinkedIn but in a perfect world (my mind ha), posting a job advert would entitle having to fill out the required information such as:

• Job Title

• Industry

• Number of years experience required in the same/related role

• Skills required

• Number of recommendations for certain skills required by the role.

Applying for jobs through LinkedIn with this system would be a vast improvement in my opinion. Just submit your profile to the job post, and when the job poster has received a number of applicants that they deem appropriate the job posting is automatically taken down (this would get rid of annoying job posts that have been up for months and months). 

After the job posting has been taken down, the job poster would just look at all the profiles in descending order, with the profiles matching all the criteria previously chosen by the poster at the top of the list. 

The job poster is then free to look through the profiles of every applicant to find the perfect candidate for their advertised role, contacting each candidate chosen to give them a chance to submit a letter why they'd be perfect for the role.

Sorry for the long winded rant but I truly believe this system would vastly improve both the job seekers experience in applying for jobs through LinkedIn, and the job posters experience by not having to wade through hundreds of applications across different job sites. 

TL;DR: LinkedIn is unnecessary when applying for jobs, it's just a generic glorified job advertising website that links you to other generic job advertising websites where you have to enter the same information on your LinkedIn profile over and over",1573439223.0,2019-11-10 21:27:03

She’ll forward it to me the same morning but it’s early enough in the morning that I’m either sleeping or haven’t checked my work emails yet. She sent one to me this morning after a long weekend and I missed the meeting. 
How should I respond to this?

Update: 
My boss and I had a 1-1 where she told me she was surprised I did not join the meeting. I told her I checked my email late last night to see if she had set up a meeting and she didn’t. Just for more info this was a meeting that she had mentioned she would set up which is why I was looking for the invite last night and since I didn’t see one I assumed it wasn’t yet scheduled.

More info— 
My boss told me about this meeting at 4:30pm on Friday over a call and she had mentioned she would “probably” set when one up Tuesday morning. We had a long weekend so when I checked my email last night (Monday night, a holiday) there was nothing there, so I assumed “okay she probably ended up not setting up the meeting”. Not only this but when I got the email invitation today it turns out she sent the email invitation out earlier than the meeting that took place with me on  on Friday where she told me she would probably set up a meeting. I asked her to send me an invite as soon as she set it up. Given that she is my manager I did not think I need to keep following up with her on a meeting that she told me she would set up and send. Also, even if at any point I had followed up with her, the soonest I would have gotten a response is early Tuesday morning  (since Monday was a holiday). My normal day starts at 9am and I get paid hourly. My boss knows this as I have had this discussion with her.",1590536970.0,2020-05-26 19:49:30

Here’s my secret: I was completely naked every time.

It started on accident. I was expecting a call at noon, then 12:15 rolled around and I needed to shit. I am most comfortable pooping entirely naked, so I stripped down and pooped. Right after I was done, I got the phone call and did my interview from the toilet. I got the job.

Ever since, I have taken every phone interview that I could completely nude. The times I did phone interviews where I had to be clothed (ie. In my car in a parking lot) I did not get the job. It’s definitely a power move. You know something they don’t, and that gives you an edge.

This is of course supplementary advice, be prepared and do your homework and have questions for your interviewer. All standard interview advice still applies.

It just applies a little better when you’re naked.

I think using a spreadsheet was super helpful for keeping a link to original job posts, tracking which applications are complete and which have been accepted or denied. I would post a link to the template but it's probably just easier to set one up yourself without giving away my email.

Spreadsheet: [https://imgur.com/WmZrMtd](https://imgur.com/WmZrMtd)

* Not accepted = never heard back
* Denied = found out by checking their website
* Denied (date) = notified via email
* Empty = still haven't heard back

&#x200B;

Here is some advice that I figured out from searching:

&#x200B;

**Make a spreadsheet**

* Link the original post. If you get an interview, you can pull up the post and review the responsibilities/qualifications.

**Apply on the company website when possible, or try to find the same job post on company website**

* Applying on the company site lets you check your status, and often gives you confirmation when your application has been received
* Sites like **ZipRecruiter, UnltdCareers, ResumeLibrary** are the worst as they don't have a way to check your application or communicate with the job-poster

**Cover letters suck, but they are your best chance to add personality to your application and communicate with employer**

* *Write the address of the job in your cover letter*. If you just send out cover letters like they are automated, it will look like it. Show the employer you at least looked up their company and know where it's located.
* *State how you will make company better* instead of just listing off your skills. Make the cover letter read like a conversation (""I see you are looking for an employee with X. I have experience with X when I used it for \*blah\*"")
* I keep a general cover letter format for different types of jobs, then I use it as a reference to write the tailored version of each letter

**If you're not having luck finding a career/full-time job, find a structured part-time job/hobby**

* Nothing is worse than waiting by your inbox for applications to come through, only to be rejected
* Having a part-time job/hobby (volunteering, coaching, anything 10-20 hrs/week) to get you out of the house and interacting with people can make your days much less depressing.

488,I used to work in HR and reviewed thousands of résumés. Here are my tips based on that experience (which involved a lot of me getting pissed off at really bad résumés). Happy to answer questions.,416,1ib8x4,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1ib8x4/i_used_to_work_in_hr_and_reviewed_thousands_of/,116,"**EDIT, 8/17/2015:** I still get one PM every week or two from folks looking for résumé advice based on this post. Since it's been so long since I worked in HR, **I'm really not comfortable giving advice like this anymore.** If you're looking for advice, **please just post to /r/jobs!** 

*(My experience is entirely in the US; other regions may have different preferences. This advice is geared towards those who don't have years of full-time experience and are applying to entry-level-ish positions,  i.e. your average in-their-20s Redditor.*

*Also, the usual disclaimer: Every employer is different, and there's no one-size-fits-all list of rules for résumés. Use your head, and get opinions from other people.)*

**1. Your résumé must be one page.**

There are CVs (curricula vitae) and there are résumés. A CV can be however long it needs to be: its purpose is to tell an employer pretty much everything about you and your work history. If an employer wants a CV, they'll explicitly ask for it.

A résumé is like a one-page magazine ad. Its purpose isn't to tell everything about you — it's to make you stand out from everyone else. It will be glanced at for 3-10 seconds, during which you must interest the reader enough to make them keep reading or you'll be discarded. 

It's made even more difficult by how a résumé is *unlike* a magazine ad: instead of being printed in color and sandwiched by interesting articles, it'll very likely be printed in black and white using a crappy office printer and sandwiched by several dozen other résumés in a big stack. This leads to Point 2...

**2. Layout's really freaking important.**

Each item should have no more than 3 lines of descriptive info below it, whether that's 1 one-line bullet point and 1 two-line bullet point, 3 one-line bullet points, or one three-line paragraph. (3 lines is a *maximum*, not a recommended amount.)

Your résumé should be only black and white/grayscale. It will be printed out along with several hundred other résumés using a crappy black-and-white office printer. The colors will appear as gray, which doesn't attract the eye.

Many web-safe and/or sans-serif fonts (like Arial) don't read well.

Balance your blank space. Too little and you have a wall of text that will never get read. Too much and you look like you have no experience and/or no idea what you're doing. Have 1"" margins on all sides, use no smaller than 11pt font with regular spacing, and leave a blank line between each item/section.

For each work/education experience, this is the order in which the following should be presented to the reviewer: company (or school) name, job title, job date, job location.

**3. Don't include any info that goes without saying.**

You list ""bank teller"" as one of your job experiences. That's great! You don't need to explain on the résumé what your duties were — unless they were something beyond what a normal person would expect a bank teller to do (you led a major marketing campaign for your bank in your town that increased revenue by $50K) or accomplish (you won Employee of the Year).

Ditto for the vast majority of retail, sales, and food service jobs.

**Also**, you probably shouldn't include work experience from more than 6 years ago unless it's very relevant or you've working full-time specifically in your field for more than 6 years. If you've graduated from college, you probably shouldn't include your high school on your résumé.

**4. You don't need an ""Objective"".**

Everyone's objective is the same: ""to get a job"". Rephrase that however you will, it'll still read like fluff, won't add any value, and will just take up valuable space.

**5. If a verb doesn't describe a concrete action, you probably don't need it.**

*Leveraged, developed, contributed, managed, coordinated, produced, brainstormed*... These are all ""fluff"". They rarely add any meaning to your résumé and detract from its read-at-a-glance-ability. *Co-authored, lectured, built, cooked, taught*, etc. are physical actions.

For example, instead of writing:

*Managed company's Salesforce database and organized and maintained data
Produced high-quality vector graphics using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, and added to company's website using intermediate HTML, CSS, and Javascript*

...just write:

* CRM software: Salesforce, use and back-end development

* Vector graphic design: Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator

* Static web design: HTML, CSS, Javascript

**6. ""Qualifications"" should be mostly proper nouns.**

Certifications you've earned, software you've used, and so on. Things that ARE NOT QUALIFICATIONS:

*Hardworking, motivated, creative individual*

*Mathematically and technologically-savvy*

*Friendly and outgoing personality*

**7. Your grammar, spelling, and punctuation must be as perfect as humanly possible.**

Some other HR people with whom I worked didn't consider this to be so important. Every single time they hired someone whose résumé didn't have immaculate language, that person ended up being a less-than-outstanding employee.

Having perfect language conveys to the reviewer that you're smart, you know how to communicate, and you care enough about this position to triple-check your résumé and make sure there are no errors.

493,Tips for those looking for remote work: the resources I successfully used to get a full-time remote job,414,7xqdvt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7xqdvt/tips_for_those_looking_for_remote_work_the/,41,"I had a full-time remote job for four years. I'd still have it, but unfortunately the agency I was working for closed in December. Since then I've been job searching and the majority of my search has been for remote opportunities. Over the last two months, I've applied to 99 jobs and only 5 of those have been 100% in-office opportunities. Now, I will begin with the caveat that I work in a remote-friendly industry: marketing. Some industries and roles are going to be more remote friendly than others - them's just the breaks, I'm afraid.
   
With that said, however, I believe it is achievable to find remote work. Will it be the type of remote work that you've always dreamed of? Maybe not. For those without a ton of job experience or in remote-unfriendly industries looking to make a switch, a customer service or administrative role at a remote-friendly company might be a good first step. You might also consider being a virtual assistant to get started. Think about your skill set and how it can be applied to a remote job. You might need to get creative. (And probably need a kickass cover letter.)
   
I think the information I gathered during my first remote job search four years ago and what I've been doing over the past two months might be helpful for some people on this sub, so I've decided to share how I job search every day. I'm not any kind of remote work guru, but here's how I search for my full-time remote marketing roles:
   
* I use Indeed.com and have a few different saved searches. In the ""Where"" field I put the keywords ""Remote"" or ""Home Based."" When I don't fill in the ""Where"" field, I will put something relevant in the ""What"" field, for example ""Remote Digital Marketing."" (Yes, this will occasionally return listings that say 'This is not a remote position,' but it will return WFH jobs, too.)
* Use the same search tactics/keywords as Indeed on LinkedIn, Monster and Glassdoor's job search tools.
* Use telecommuterjobs.net to search all Craiglist jobs that have indicated they are open to telecommuting. Just like on your local Craiglist, you can search based on job type and industry. (You'll need to put on your Craiglist ""is this a scam or legit?"" hat for this. Be aware of scams and be mindful. This is how I found my last remote job, which lasted for 4 years.)
* I recommend a daily/weekly peek at weworkremotely.com, remoteok.io, remote.co, and https://nodesk.co/remote-work/
* If you're interested in working for a startup, use AngelList (angel.co). There are a variety of fields you can use to narrow down your search, including Role, Job Type, Keywords, etc. Under the Location tab, you'll want to select ""Remote OK.""
* Use Google's job search feature. Literally just Google ""remote jobs"" and look through the listings or include keywords relevant to your experience.
* Check out [this article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurashin/2018/01/17/work-from-home-2018-the-top-100-companies-for-remote-jobs/#4f8cbd7376f0) from Forbes about 100 companies with remote opportunities.
* Browse [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1TLJSlNxCbwRNxy14Toe1PYwbCTY7h0CNHeer9J0VRzE/htmlview?sle=true) of over **600** startups that hire remote. Don't be discouraged if there seem to be a lot of development/technical companies on this sheet - these companies often hire for other roles, too.
* Always be on the lookout. Does something seem too good to be true? Evaluate WFH opportunities carefully because, yes, there will be scams (some more clever than others) mixed in with the real stuff.
   
**What to do if you get an interview with a remote company?**
   
If you've never worked remotely before, a portion of the interview process is certainly going to include questions designed to determine how you'll handle that environment. 
   
Often interviewers want to hear that you are capable of managing your time well and can work independently while also staying in communication. They'll want a sense that you won't go crazy from having zero social interaction, so share plans for managing that (for example, working at a coffee shop or coworking space when needed). You should also mention that you will stay organized by setting up a designated work area and desk. Yeah, the dream is to work on the beach, but that's not what you want to talk about in the interview. Share that you are willing and able to set up a quiet, distraction-free home office or dedicated work area.
   
The big fear that many companies have with remote employees is that they'll waste company time or won't get work done. You'll want to emphasize your work ethic and communication skills.",1518730626.0,2018-02-15 16:37:06

I was the same way. But after I landed my current job, my manager gave me advice that totally changed the wayI interview. I have since interviewed multiple times and have felt extremely more confident than I did in the past. I've interviewed in several formats. 1:1, panel interviews, group interviews... You name it I've done it. I would always get nervous and tense up. This would then show when answering questions.

**Advice:** My manager told me that when you think of an interview, just remind yourself that you're just dealing with people. They're exactly like you. They can't hurt you, they're not going to yell at you. They're everyday people like you and me looking to find someone for a job. Yes, some have fancy titles or drive fancy cars, but they're just another person in this world. So if you go into the interview with the mindset that you would when you talk to a cashier or one of your friends, you will naturally calm your nerves. You will then be more relaxed and your interview presence will show it.

496,How I imagine some employers plan their interactions with applicants,403,94lbmm,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/94lbmm/how_i_imagine_some_employers_plan_their/,39,"**The Website**

1) Have an entire section of the website devoted to career opportunities.  Know that the typical job seeker does not want to merely see a list open positions.  Instead they want to read an article about how much we love our neighborhood, possibly including a video with stock footage of local attractions.  There must be pictures of racially diverse models portraying employees smiling and sitting in front of a computer screen while one of them points to said screen.

2) When there are fewer than 20 job listings, the listings must still be broken down into multiple categories, rather than all being visible on a single page.  This gives the impression that HR is really organized.

3) If there are lots of openings, have them default to being sorted by some obscure criterion, like the name of the building they’re located in.  The less intuitive the system, the more time the job seeker will spend on the website applying to jobs and thinking about our company.

**Applying Online**

1) Job descriptions must not be proofread, as that would be a waste of company time.  To really save time, occasionally throw in an opening without any description at all or one in which the instructions to the poster are still present.  This isn’t like a resume or cover letter, where any typo or mistake is disgraceful and an instant turn off.

2) Don’t specify which criteria are required and which are preferred.  Better yet, don’t make the qualifications logically consistent.  For example, say you either want someone with a bachelor’s degree and 2 years of experience of someone with a master’s degree and 5 years of experience.  

3) Add in a required credential without hinting at the reasoning for it.  It makes the organization seem more supportive of intellectualism if it’s looking for accountants familiar with medical terminology or IT professionals working from home who are trained in CPR. 

4) Require that applicants must have at least 3 years of experience in a computer program that has existed for 6 months, and for which training is only available to those who seek out a wise old man residing at the top of a mountain somewhere in Nepal.

5) All applicants must create a profile with a username.  The rules for creating a password, such as whether it must include capital letters, will not be shown to the applicant until they’ve filled out the rest of their information.  Having a profile will not allow the applicant to do anything helpful like check application status or apply to other jobs more easily.  If a system is in place to allow previous applicants to submit future applications more easily, there must be some hindrance added, such as prohibiting them from editing their cover letter for the second job. 

6) Applications will autofill based on the applicant’s resume for some of the application, not autofill for another section, and autofill from the wrong parts of the resume for others.  No matter what, the entire content of the resume will need to be entered again word-for-word at some portion of the application.

7) It must not be clear until the end of the application whether it is necessary or possible to attach documents like a cover letter.

8) All applicants must state the exact date during which they began working for a previous employer, not just the month and year.  An extra <30 days worked can mean the difference between a senior level and entry level worker, and nobody would ever forget the day they began a job approximately 10 years ago. 

9) Information for a background check, including a social security number, must be included before even getting a phone screen.  Most applicants won’t get a background check, and if they do, it won’t be for weeks, but it’s important that the company has as much information as possible that could attract identity thieves.  Remember, if there’s a security breach and we need to reach out to the affected individuals, they’ll be thinking about us, which is good for business.

**Phone Screens/Interviews**

1) If you schedule a phone interview with a candidate and you call them 2 minutes after the arranged time, apologize profusely.  If you schedule a phone interview with a candidate and you call them 45 minutes late, don’t acknowledge it.  Apologizing would be a sign of weakness and dissuade the candidate from wanting a job with us.

2) If you call the candidate unannounced, state the name of the company and job title as quickly as possible so they have a hard time looking up what they applied to.  Better yet, use an abbreviation for the company’s name that’s unknown to non-employees.  Start off by assuming they know exactly who you are and by asking them “Do you have any questions about the job description?”  This technique is much more effective if it’s been a month since they applied and they’ve presumably looked at hundreds of other job descriptions since then. 

3) Ask specifically about a qualification that you want in a candidate that was not listed in the job description.  Get angry when the candidate suggests that they don’t have the corresponding skill or certification.

**Interviews**

1) Wait a month after the phone screen before scheduling an interview.  It lets the candidate build up excitement and anticipation for this momentous event.

2) A worthy job candidate is flexible and committed to getting the job.  Therefore, you should only offer times to come in that are within the next 2 days at a few specific times.  No exceptions are necessary if the candidate lives hours away in another state.

3) An important quality to look for is leadership.  A good leader forges their own path.  With that in mind, don’t give the candidate clear instructions on where to park and how to find the interviewer(s).  If possible, schedule the interview at a company facility in a different city from the company’s main building without informing them.

4) Ask generic, cliché questions that all interviewers use, even if you don’t care what the answer is.  If you don’t ask “What’s your greatest weakness?” the candidate won’t respect you and take you seriously. 

5) Ask about salary but don’t provide any information about what the company may offer.  There’s no reason to believe that that would have any impact on whether they want to continue pursuing this job. 

6) Invite the candidate back for another couple of rounds of interviews.  You need to be sure that they fit in with the company’s culture before you hire them, so it would be too risky to hire a new custodian based on only 45 minutes of interviewing.

**Other**

1) When it can be avoided at all, never update the candidate on their status.  Getting rejected makes people sad, so give them the excitement, thrill, and mystery of not knowing where they stand.  

2) After all the interviews are complete, just give the job to the boss’ daughter’s college roommate’s ex-boyfriend’s buddy.  He’s basically family, even if he doesn’t actually have any relevant work experience. ",1533436423.0,2018-08-04 22:33:43
497,"After two YEARS and many false starts, rejections, let downs, and tears, I found an AWESOME new job. Start July 1.",413,c2xjgw,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c2xjgw/after_two_years_and_many_false_starts_rejections/,25,"I just wanted to share my success story. It DOES sometimes work out! 

I've been in my field for 10 years. I've steadily grown my skills, experience, and competencies and can say I'm mid-career at this point. I'm an independent contributor for life, probably. I do research, technical writing, video production, graphic design, and curriculum design (plus training and data collection and implementation of LMS) for training materials. Specialty is satellite technology and ESL for call centers. 

I was hired by Company A 4 years ago. Company B (MegaCorp) bought Company A immediately after my hire. The culture was slow to change, but the changes really accelerated and took effect in the last two years and started making me very unhappy. 

I spent two years job hunting. I was flown out to a major private space exploration company in L.A. for a final-round interview that I narrowly missed out on, and was devastated just under 2 years ago. That took some time to rebound from--I had already mentally moved to L.A. and started work for Glamourous Dream Co. It hurt. It shook my confidence.  

I got an offer for a lateral move to a stuffy hidebound heritage insurance corp and the offer was only a few thousand over what I was making and they *maxed* out their range for me. I turned it down very reluctantly and shed a few tears wondering if I made the wrong choice. This was just over 18 months ago. 

I had 3 interviews I either withdrew or was knocked out of the competition with the same damn company making Luxury Window Coverings. The company itself was really nice and the people were awesome. But the building was a windowless 70s bunker in a really tragic industrial park wasteland part of town. And I couldn't care less about their discount Window Coverings perk. 

I did probably 25+ first round and 10+ second or final round interview in the last year alone. Over 50 interviews in the last 2, counting phone screens, first round, final, etc. I probably submitted about 100+ applications, although I don't ""crop dust"", I try to target jobs and companies I'm excited about. (Call me, LEGO! heh.)

I ramped up my job search and targeted companies and products I was excited about, tweaked my cover letter and resume, and updated my LinkedIn. I finally landed a job with a 25% raise plus bonus, very strong benefits, and a hip downtown coworking space office with a startup arm of a larger telecommunications corp. I'm very excited and looking forward to the challenges and growth opportunities. 

I really struggled these last two years, even though I had a decent job with a boss and coworkers and work I enjoyed. I was just at odds with the overall company culture and couldn't take another yearly RIF. 

It CAN happen. It DOES happen. I got some valuable tips from r/resumes and a stroke of luck and had to white-knuckle my way through a background check that included international searches due to my overseas jobs but I made it! 

You can too! Keep trying and keep your head up.

I have enough free time at work, most times, that I can browse and apply for jobs which is nice. I just heard back from a position asking if I can do a phone interview anytime from 8-12.

Well... I mean no not really. Even though I can browse for jobs on my computer, I don't feel comfortable having an actual phone interview during business hours. My boss does not know I'm looking for a new job, so I can't just tell him ""Hey I've got a job interview, I'll be in late"".

So my only 2 options seem to be A.) Lie and say I have a doctors appointment or something to get off work. Or B.) request the interview be off hours. I don't really feel comfortable doing the first option, especially if I'll be doing several interviews presumably. So I'm kinda stumped.

EDIT: Thanks for the comments everyone. Everyone was pretty much saying the same thing, but hey it's what I needed to hear. Good news, I was easily able to switch the phone interview till 1pm, which was no problem for the recruiter. I stepped outside, took the call, and don't think the boss ever noticed I was gone. Piece of cake. On top of that... it sounded really promising, so it may go on to the next phase of the interview process. For that, I'm pretty much gonna have to take the day off, so I'll go with the doctor's appointment excuse.",1570753270.0,2019-10-10 20:21:10

Currently I’m working as a waiter right now trying to get by while I’m job hunting. My dream is to work in a office job but I’m finding this difficult. I’ve been applying to over hundreds of entry level jobs but it seems like no one wants to hire me.

I went to a 4 year college and got BS in hospitality and management and originality I wanted to open my own restaurant. I’ve had 10 plus years working in the restaurant business because my parents used to owned a restaurant and I wanted to follow their footsteps. I’ve also done an internship at an accounting firm during the summer while I was still in college. I’ve worked at various other restaurant jobs like line cook and waiter. But now I want to switch careers and it seems it’s so hard to even get my foot in the door.

What can I do to help improve my chances of getting an interview and being hired? What position should be easier for me to apply to with no prior experience? I have also thought of going back to school and maybe take some accounting courses at H&R Block. I’ve done some bookkeeping and I really liked it and I wish I stuck with it.

Why not include more before I click the link? Why not include some relevant tags so I have some idea of what the job is. The vast majority of job titles tell you almost nothing about the job itself so the entire search results page is kinda useless when it's all slight variations of ""Mechanical Engineer"". The Boolean operations help slightly with this but they can be a bit heavy handed. 

It drives me nuts how little of the actual page they use for relevant information too. The description previews are fucking tiny and yet I have these massive columns on either side that just blank. Use more of that screen real estate for something fucking useful! Same goes for the search field. It's like a quarter of the length it should be. When I'm dropping in a ton of Booleans, I end scrolling for days to see everything I have in it or to get to the end when I could easily see all of it at once if the damn box was just bigger. 

The employers are mostly to blame for this one but damn the experience level criteria filter is fucking awful. I'd go so far as to say it's just about useless honestly. I don't know how exactly it determines if something is entry level or not but it does a terrible job of finding those positions. It includes things that aren't entry level or, again, it's way too heavy handed and might only include things that specifically say ""entry level"", which is not that many jobs. Most specify an experience range but it seems to struggle with those. 

It drives me nuts how bad it is at the one thing it's supposed to do well. The only thing it has going for it really is the sheer volume of positions on it and the name recognition.",1532039679.0,2018-07-19 18:34:39
505,Found a job after 7 months of being unemployed,402,imxgw3,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/imxgw3/found_a_job_after_7_months_of_being_unemployed/,31,"Hi everyone. This post might seem somewhat unusual to many of you, however, I’ve already seen dozens of similar posts here, so I guess it will be okay if there’s one more post of that kind. Personally I don’t really consider this thing motivational/inspirational or anything, but at the same time I believe that everything written below might actually help some people or at least cheer them up regardless of circumstances. I would want everybody to read this until the end. I know it might be time consuming, but still...

I worked in the tourism industry for nearly 4 years and managed to build a pretty successful career there within such a short time, all on my own, without anybody’s help (I’m not trying to show off or whatsoever). At the very beginning I felt like that was exactly what I wanted to do, I actually thought it was 100% my thing. I wish you knew how wrong I was, but at the end of the day, can a 17-year-old with little life experience be smart? I don’t think so. I was absobloodylutely fascinated by each and every single aspect of the job I had and neglected all the limitations. I started as a Tour Guide and finished as a Senior Operations Manager. I couldn't even imagine myself working at a travel agency as the start was pretty much unexpected and impromptu.

As far as you all know, work in this particular industry implies loads of constant communication with people from all over the world (including those you don't know). At 17 I was an extravert, so I have to admit that I was super chuffed. Later I realised how silly and wrong I was. Hundreds of mental clients whose requirements and desires were just otherworldly, aggressive colleagues (I can understand them though), toxic environment overall... all of this started to bring me down and literally opened my eyes. Every summer I had to work super hard 24/7. I'm a multitasker used to working in a busy environment, but I also need spare time for personal stuff. Work-life balance was nonexistent. 

Obviously some of you who work(ed) in the tourism industry might have had a completely different experience which is understandable. I believe that tourism could be a good career start, but I don't think that it's exactly what one should dedicate their whole life to. Again, it's just my personal opinion, so if you have a different point of view, it's absolutely okay. If a person is social and enjoys constant communication as well as loves meeting new people every now and then, tourism might actually be very good for them. 

However, I feel like those 4 years have almost completely changed my personality. Once an open, friendly and social teen, and now a distant and somewhat aloof guy. At the same time I have to admit that it was a great lesson for me. The whole thing helped me sort out my priorities and determine what exactly I wanted to do, which field I desired to grow in. I've gained and developed loads of useful skills that do help in real life. Negotiation, active listening, verbal and written communication... the list could go on and on. I also managed to significantly improve my German and Spanish. I mastered Excel, Amadeus and many other software programmes, high proficiency in which is needed almost everywhere now.

It was a great start, but I just feel like I could actually make a career change much earlier, perhaps at 19. Last December (when I was 20) I had two burnouts in a row because I couldn't cope with all that stuff at work anymore. It was so damn overwhelming, holidays didn't help at all. Anxiety and depression started to creep up on me. I ended up being rushed into hospital and getting medical treatment there. That was the moment I decided to quit. Forever. 

After Christmas holidays I gave my boss a resignation letter. He was really upset, but understood me and wished me good luck. I took a notice period and then left. I'm currently doing my Master's (one more year left), so I focused on my studies and chose not to look for a job. Moreover, I sort of knew and could predict that covid-19 was going to spread across the globe and damage every country's economy. I also knew that tourism would collapse and consequently fall apart. It's happened. All of my former peers are unemployed at the moment.

I promised myself and everybody else that I would never get back to tourism no matter what. I needed a career change. I'm a naturally creative person with decent copywriting, editing and proofreading skills, so I though that it would help. I've been doing a lot of freelance work in the past 5 years, and this definitely has improved my creative skills. In addition, the second travel agency I worked for often asked me to collaborate with their marketing department in case they wanted to launch another campaign. I really enjoyed it, and both my boss and the head of marketing department started to assign loads of various tasks to me including making videos, writing advertising articles, launching marketing campains etc. I'm good at video content creation/development probably because it's been one of my primary interests for years now. I started to work with Sony Vegas and Adobe Premiere Pro when I was a teen. I loved it, I really did. I've been making so much stuff using these two since then... I had never even though that one day it would become my job.

In March I started to look for a job. I was afraid that I would never find a job in a different industry, at the same time I didn't want to work at a call centre nor be a cleaner/waiter etc, although I could. I started to apply to various jobs, I literally lived on LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor and other websites as well as kept monitoring different companies' websites in order to stay updated on new vacancies. Guess what? Either rejected or ignored! No calls/emails, no interviews... absolutely nothing! I felt so devastaded, so I desperately started to apply to all jobs ignoring things like company's name, job description and employee reviews. There was still nothing.

I've been quite active here as well since then. I've been trying to get help/advice here. In June I received 7 calls and 4 emails, proceeded to 3 interviews with 3 different companies. I was ghosted by the first two after the inital interview, the third one first said they liked me and then they rejected me for no reason and didn't really explain anything. I couldn't deal with it any longer and wanted to die. Rejection followed by another rejection followed by ghosting and so on. 

At the beginning of August I had an interview with a small IT company, and they made me a job offer, but there was absolutely no info about them on the Internet, plus I found people who worked for them on LinkedIn, they told me that the turnover rate was quite high, working conditions were poor etc. I rejected the offer. I even started to think about getting back to tourism or a similar thing, but then I accidentally came across a website of a pretty large well-known company that was founded back in late 1940-s.

There was a role I liked. I sort of knew it was useless to apply, but still did. Suddenly a person from the marketing department called me, we had a very brief phone conversation, and the guy said that he'd passed my data on to the HR managers. They called me later that day, and we had a phone interview. I thought it was the end, but... they arranged a Skype interview with me, the hiring process started. I honestly didn't expect that. I feel much better now. They made me an offer, and I accepted it. I've already finished my very first week at work, I have to admit that I’ve enjoyed every moment of it! The whole process has been extremely complicated, but it's all in the past now. Great people, good working conditions, opportunities for career growth, loads of benefits, nearly 3 months off, high salary, work-life balance... what else do I need?

I've already written a lot of stuff, so I just want you guys to know that you shouldn't worry about anything. Apply, keep applying. I know it's tough, especially now, but please go for it! You never know what can happen. A job can come from a place you'd never thought it would come from. Believe in yourself, forget the phrase 'to underestimate oneself'. Tailor your CV, write cover letters, your time will come. Be genuine, honest and modest, always tell the truth. Try to be as friendly and polite as possible. Employers admire it. I would also recommend to apply directly on the company's website or by emailing them, it might significantly boost your chances. Don't overthink. If you want more advice or have ay questions, do not hesitate to contact me. Remember: each person is great and unique in their own way. Work hard, and it will pay off. Do your best.

I've been told to ""just put up with it."" If you take a step back and realize that there is nothing divine about this system and that it's totally invented and flawed, you begin to realize how much of your life is simply wasted. Just because ""that's just how it is."" What a shitty excuse.

She would not give me any guidance and then accuse me of not taking initiative, how am I supposed to take initiatives on things I don't know about. And then they told me in the firing meeting that they thought I would just come in and take over the responsibilities on my own. Seriously how? They literally told me nothing about what I'm supposed to do except help their sister. Thats the only job description I got. Besides, we didn't have much projects over the summer, and I perfectly worked them last one and another one I was working on. When they hired me they didn't look at my transcripts or anything although I offered. Geez people are weird man. I'm honestly glad I got fired. It's like a burden being lifted. Seriously feeling so much better. Because this whole time I really thought I was the one to blame. My confidence is back.

511,"I gave 2 weeks notice, boss flipped out on me, everyone is upset with me, how do I survive the next 2 weeks?",405,ba4jdh,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/ba4jdh/i_gave_2_weeks_notice_boss_flipped_out_on_me/,356,"Hi everyone,

I started my job last year, I was inexperienced, fresh out of grad school and desperate for a job in my field. I didn't mind that the salary was  less than expected and what my fellow graduates were making. The job was also 2.5 hours away from my residence, giving me a 5 hour commute per day (by bus). Despite the unideal situation I accepted the offer.

Due to my inexperience the first couple of months were a roller coaster as I did my best to do what I thought my supervisors wanted only to realize occasionally that I had misunderstood. Every time this would happen my supervisors would treat me like crap even though I hadn't intentionally done something wrong (many times these were minor inconsequential things that I later noticed they themselves would often make as well and brush off). I was also always quick to learn from my errors and not repeat them again. 

Please note I did a lot of things right as well and worked my ass off too, but my bosses were extremely critical and only focused on my mistakes, they never noticed the things I did well or if they did notice they wouldn't comment on it. They also did not give me the training I needed to be able to fulfill their expectations in a lot of areas, eventually I asked them to train me for some stuff cause I really needed it and I had never lied on my resume for them to think I could do them. Nevertheless despite the 5 hour commute and the hostile environment, I adapted and began doing exceptionally well by the sixth month.

Fast forward 8 months. By now I had gotten sick and tired of my commute, could not do it anymore, moving closer to my workplace not possible as my fiance and I live together and his workplace is in the opposite direction and if we moved he would be commuting 6 hours per day. I had also gotten sick and tired of my colleagues esp boss who was a complete jerk to me whenever he felt foul. So I began job hunting and about 4 months later I got a position at a new firm 20 minutes away from my house with a higher salary and more benefits. Unfortunately another junior colleague (only 2 juniors) had also gotten a new job offer and was leaving too. She beat me to it in the sense that she got to resign before me. This meant that I was the only junior left to help out.

The new employer needed me to start within two weeks as they were swamped and were not flexible. I tried to negotiate a later day and was unsuccessful. So basically on my colleagues last day (after her two weeks notice) I handed in my resignation to my boss (I had no other choice based on the start date). This is how it went:

""hi as you know my commute has been really difficult etc. I really love working with you and this company and it's the only reason I've been able to commute as long as I have. I have a new offer now and it's really close to my house and they need me to start in two weeks, I'm so sorry to do this today but I have no other choice..... Etc. I hope you can understand, I'm so sorry about the timing, I wanted to start later to help out with the new hired guy but they weren't flexible with the date "" (they had just sent out an offer to a new guy another colleague recommended to replace my departing colleague)

Him: ""help?? Help out how?! You've put this company is a very difficult position, you've put us all in an extremely hard place. Help new employee?? The guy we sent an offer to hasn't even accepted yet so you've made things worse, help out? Just put your letter on the table and GO!!!"" (he said all this in the angriest and harshest tone, slightly yelling; he then turned his back to me and went on his computer and ignored me)

me: ""I'm really sorry, thank you again for everything""

Him: \*dead silent, keeps back to me, is waiting for me to get out\*

Then he kicked me out of his office without another word....

So I went to the womens bathroom and cried hysterically . I knew it was gonna be rough but I had thought they would be more understanding. I hadn't planned to leave at the same time as my colleague, I didn't even know she was planning on leaving. I expected him to be more professional and maybe express some thank you that I worked so hard and was always on time with everything despite travelling 5 hours a day to to this job.

So my question is, how can I survive the next 2 weeks here? Thinking of going back to work for the next two weeks while dealing with my supervisors death glares and silent treatment is agonizing. I know they need me to help out so I will be there despite how pissed everyone is at me and all the cold shoulders, but any advice to make this easier would be very appreciated.

UPDATE:

Hi just an update. So my two weeks are over as of today. It went OK. I was very professional and I did a really great job on my final reports, I could tell even they were impressed. They were very professional with me until the last day. Typically at our firm it is common that we take the person out (or gather the manager does) for lunch with everyone else before wishing them well. My manager didn't do this and completely ignored me the whole day. One of them left before the end of the day without even saying goodbye to me. When I went to say bye to the main manager he was very quick to turn his back and basically make it obvious he didn't care. I did a really good job being professional and I really worked my butt off these last two weeks to make their lives easier. They are not grateful for any of it. Do I regret what I did? No because now I can leave with a full conscience knowing I was professional and a good human being. For anyone else who goes through this in the future or now, you have my sympathy. It's hard but stay strong and power through. I really believe in being the bigger and better person. I was taken for granted but hopefully in my new job I won't be.",1554587802.0,2019-04-06 17:56:42
512,Im getting really frustrated about minimum wage jobs needing lots of experience.,402,adij4f,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/adij4f/im_getting_really_frustrated_about_minimum_wage/,89,"I'm 19F, attending college and just looking for a part time job to help me get by with travelling costs etc. I've been applying to everything I can for 6 months and still hearing nothing. I know my CV is ok, because we did a class about it, and I have work experience on my CV which is related to my course. But because this would be my first paying job, I have no actual experience. And yet everywhere I look for a job they are asking for at least a years experience in the related job and if you don't you'll get filtered out by the online process.

I'm talking about like waitressing or retail assistant or fast food jobs, it's insane. One local restaurant had an ad for a waiter job, asked for 2+ years experience in it but it was minimum wage??? Why would anyone spend two years at one restaurant and then move to this other restaurant that's paying the same or less?? I don't get it at all. Surely minimum wage is entry level and entry level means you will need to be trained?  

My guess is it's an excuse to pay the least amount of money but still not have to take the time to train someone.

It's really frustrating me. I know I would be a good worker if I was given the chance, but there's no hope of me getting one. Most of my friends have jobs now too, but all of them bar one has gotten in with connections, i.e their dad knows the owner etc. I don't have any connections like that because my family aren't from here. Has anyone got any tips? I'm reaching the end of my tether.

515,It's official - After 5 years of unemployment I got a job!,405,5tm5bl,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/5tm5bl/its_official_after_5_years_of_unemployment_i_got/,59,"I'm posting this in the hopes that it can serve as a hopeful story for those in a similar position. I dealt with  undiagnosed mental health issues throughout college (bipolar) and for several years after graduation. About a year ago I finally found a doctor who got me on the right meds, and I started looking for a job. 

I had very little luck. After several hundred apps with zero responses I realized I'd have to say I've been doing *something* since graduating, so I said I did computer repair work locally (not totally untrue - I do help people with computers, I just didn't tell them that it wasn't a full-time gig and that I wasn't getting paid). This at least started getting me call-backs. 

 I got an in-person last April that didn't work out and dozens of phone interviews after that, all to no avail. For the last 6 months I've basically just been going through the motions, pretty much resigned to the fact that I'm unemployable but figuring I have no excuse to stop sending out apps. About a month ago I got what I expected to be another dead-end phone interview. Somehow I must have impressed them and they flew me out for an interview earlier this month. 

I was still fairly pessimistic but again figured I had no excuse not to try. I prepared like hell for the interview. I googled them. I looked them up on YouTube and read all their financial statements and literally everything I could find on them. I prepared two pages of relevant and insightful questions about the company and the industry based on my research. I borrowed $300 and bought a suit. And I absolutely nailed the interview. It really didn't even feel like an interview; I knew so much about them already and about the industry and trends that it turned into a 2-hour conversation. When I left I knew they were impressed, but I was still cautious about getting optimistic for fear of being let down again. 

A week later they called me to interview with the boss, and from the time I shook his hand I knew it was in the bag save a major faux pas on my part. The guy who had interviewed me previously had obviously been talking me up and was really eager to hire me, and this second interview turned into another free-wheeling discussion on the company and this guy's history with it and his objectives for the future. 

Then yesterday I got the email. An offer of $23.75/hr to start at the beginning of next month. 

I wish I had something insightful to offer you guys, but all I can say is don't give up and prepare for every interview, phone or in-person, like you're interviewing to be president and CEO - know so much that you don't need your notes and you can not only answer anything they might throw at you, but can ask them real questions that speak to their specific situation. You never know when the stars will happen to align and it works out. 

 I'm unsubscribing now, and hope not to be here again until I need advice on salary negotiations in 6 months for my first promotion. Godspeed, fellow r/job-ers.",1486944669.0,2017-02-12 19:11:09

So I just wanted to say a big big biggggg thank you for all your support and help from my post. I posted it right before I went to what would be my last shift at that wretched place and was gobsmacked when I went on my break to have received not only over 200 comments, but also some lovely people who gave me both reddit gold and silver. That honestly made me teary. So thank you very much.

I would like to say that although it was very clear I was being bullied at work, I do have a hard time leaving bad situations and my anxiety mixed with my feelings of caring too much sometimes make it difficult. I felt a lot better typing it all up and getting it off my chest, and I am really grateful for all the advice and support I got as a result. Sometimes receiving validation and advice from unbiased anonymous strangers on the internet really does give you that push.

So on Monday I quickly typed up a 3 line resignation letter to my boss. I didn't say why I was leaving or where I was going, just that I will not be returning back to my job and cya later. I then messaged a few people who were good friends to me at work saying I had left and thanks for everything. A lot of you said to probably expect a call the next day, but I didn't get a call or email the next day. Or the day after. It's currently Friday and I was meant to have a shift yesterday but they didn't ring me when I was meant to start so I'd say they got my email and that I've fucked off. I don't think I'll hear from them again. I did try and get in touch with my country's workers union all week, but it kept ringing out. I'll keep trying. In the meantime, my mum helped me write up a letter to HR explaining my situation and the bullying I recieved. A lot of you said what they did to me was grounds for harassment and totally illegal, so I'll wait to see what my union and HR says about the matter.

But aside from that, I feel wonderful. Absolutely brilliant. As I mentioned in my post, I did quit with enough savings to last me unemployed for at least a few months, and I'm very blessed to still live at home so it's not a crisis for me. I spent the whole week (in between uni assignments) applying for jobs and hope to find something again soon.

The only question I would like to ask is what should I say if a future employee asks in the hiring process why I left this job? I plan on applying for either retail or customer service jobs because I still have another year left of my degree so I'll need the same part time student job places. I don't know if I should outright say bullying but if anyone has any suggestions feel free to say.

Thanks again for everything, this community is absolutely wonderful.

Edit: thank you to the beautiful soul who gave me silver and for everyone else’s support ❤️",1557482651.0,2019-05-10 06:04:11
518,"I got laid off 3 weeks ago, and today I accepted an offer for a huge raise, in a better company, and better gig. I'm nothing special but here is my guide that I've used many times with success.",399,3hr233,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3hr233/i_got_laid_off_3_weeks_ago_and_today_i_accepted/,59,"All I'm going to say is I'm in the nightlife management industry and basically talked my way into my first opportunity. That opportunity ended a few weeks back due to me being the least tenured member (which says a lot about their business because I was also the youngest and most intelligent guy on the team). Regardless, I hit the ground running that same day. I applied at 8 places, heard back from 6, interviewed with 5 and received 4 job offers. This will be long but please read everything it really will help! Here are my steps:

* Leave with your head held high. Do not beg for your job, their decision is made it will just make you look and feel weak. Shake their hand and thank them sincerely for the opportunity. Upper management hates letting people go and if you make things as easy as possible for them, they will respect that. Make sure to ask if they will use you as a reference and to hopefully say good things.

* Once you get home, go work out or do something to get your mind off the matter, don't cry or pout, go and let those endorphins loose. The reason for this is because you'll need it when you get home.

* Apply for unemployment right away(if you can..check with your local employment department), who knows how long it will take to find a job (hopefully quickly with this guide). At least get paid for your time.

* Update your resume. THIS IS THE SECOND MOST IMPORTANT STEP. Under each job you have make sure to say your responsibilities quickly as a summary and then bullet point your ACCOMPLISHMENTS. Many people feel the need to list what they were responsible for. Employers don't give two shits, all they want to hear is what did you get done there. I was at my last job for 7 months and I found 3 impressive things to put down, so anyone can..even if you have to take something mundane and spin it (note-DO NOT LIE) to make it sound like its an accomplishment do it. In those accomplishments some key things to include (if you did them): sales numbers that you helped increase, any systematic changes you made to help the organization run better, anything you did to help staff morale, etc. Lastly, if you had time off in between jobs a little trick I do is to only include the years you worked there. So for example, if you got laid off in March and then started working in June, you can put down 2011-2014 for the first job, then 2014-present for the second. I'll include an example below:

>**Assistant Manager/ Event Coordinator, Shanghai Nightclub**
**New York, NY — 2011- Present**
**Responsible** for interviewing, training, development, and supervising of servers, bartenders, and security. Tasks include: ensuring bar area is clean, sanitary, and up to standards for operating procedures, assessing staff, bar need/maintenance, and areas of improvement as well as counting and replenishing inventory. Also responsible for booking parties/events, creating/designing/implementing new themes and specials, and directing and improving our social media accounts.

>**Accomplishments**
>* Introduced new disciplinary system to improve accountability amongst staff as well as a merit based reward system to give well deserving staff better shifts for working hard.
>* Implemented new party reward system that saw sales increase 140%, or $18k in a 3 months.

* THE MOST IMPORTANT THING, especially in personal emails to the hiring director, is your cover letter. That alone has helped me get my interviews. I used a three headed approach: 
    * Start with interest right away ""I am interested in this position and I know I'm the man/woman for the job"". Yes it comes off as a little cocky but nothing is sexier than confidence and hiring managers will at the very least be interested to keep reading.
    * Then include your experience, but be brief with it they can see it on your resume.
    * The most important facts I can get across to you are the next two: 1. Start with ""Obviously I can say I have experience and talk about how much I would love a job like this, but we all know that means nothing when it comes right down to it. Here's what I've accomplished:"" then talk more thoroughly about what you did and why it was important at your last job. This shows that you're not just a guy/girl who punches in and punches out. 2. Talk about how YOU will change their business if you get the job. I understand that this is more tuned into my field of work but it can be used in any business. You'll have to do research about the company first (another reason why this works, they'll see that you put a lot of thought into it as opposed to someone who just copies and pastes resumes) and find out what they need to do to either A. make more money or B. shift a culture change/practice for the better. So if you're in sales, talk about how you've noticed the high turnover rates. Mention that you would increase staff bonding events to keep employees around longer, if not for the money at least for their friends. If you're in computer science, talk about how you can help promote the business to your friends and other social groups. This is so important to note because I've done this time and time again and gotten jobs that are way above my experience.

* I cannot stress how important it is to let the hiring managers, know from your initial application to your final interview, how passionate you are for the industry you are in. Granted, if you're not they will see right through it, but if you are then this will put you light years ahead of everyone. Say things like, ""I'm not looking for a job, this is my life and I love to do this"" and ""I want to be with a company who is going to help me grow and reach my dream of one day being on your executive board or own my own business as a partner of the firm"". This tells them that not only are you passionate but you're also in it for the long haul as opposed to candidate B who seems like they just want to do this because they're bored.

* Finally, being laid off is very stressful, and even when you're confident it will eventually break you down. Keep doing what you normally do. Only apply to 3 places a day that you WANT to work for, and put a ton of thought into each one, trust me it will show. Work out/get exercise whatever you need to do to keep healthy and let the brain function. Go out for a drink or social event with friends, yes I know you should be frugal but I promise you you'll feel better. Talk to your friends about it, they'll help you get through it. And if they or a significant other doesn't, dump them like there's no tomorrow. If they aren't there for you, even if its just a text, then what's the use of having them? You'll feel better trust me.

I'm sorry for the long rambling post but if this even helps one person I'll be happy. Best of luck to you all, and if you have any questions, comments, or concerns, don't downvote this let's discuss it and I will update it to make it more appealing.

**TL;DR: READ THE WHOLE THING, if you're going to cut corners on a reddit post then you will on your resume and cover letter and it will make getting a job much harder**

**EDIT:** One thing I completely forgot to mention: At the end of an interview, you should always ask 3 things (if they had not been discussed already): 1. How the interviewer got to where they are at, 2. Salary (don't be embarrassed!), and 3. This is exact line ""Is there anything that we've discussed or in my resume that might hinder me from getting this job?"" That shows two things- 1. You're not afraid to ask what you want and 2. It will give you a last ditch effort to explain or assure the hiring manager that you are the best candidate for the job!

**Edit 2:** I also wanted to ad that the best place to apply is usually not even advertised. I would go to a company's website that I wanted to work for and apply directly through there, a lot of times they aren't even hiring but I still got emails to come in. They do this because it weeds out unqualified people who just apply to everything on craigslist and gets them the people that want to work for them.

Another bit of advice (sorry if I'm rambling I'm still drunk from last night) is do not be afraid to walk away from an offer if it is not good for you. I turned down a job, without having secured one, and it ate me alive but I knew that it wouldn't be worth it especially if I was going to quit and do this again in 6 months.

When the recruiters asked me for my expected salary, I told them I'd like additional time to think about it and asked them for their budgets for the positions.  I was honestly shocked by how much higher both ranges were than what I currently make; if I'd given them my salary expectations first, I definitely would have low-balled myself by about 10-15k (even though I'd done plenty of research!). 

To all you job-seekers out there - when a recruiter tries to have the salary expectations conversation with you, do yourself a favor and ask about their salary ranges first.  I'm lucky because my state legally requires employers to disclose that info if you ask, but I think it's probably worth a shot either way.

521,"30 days ago I decided that I'm done being underpaid, overworked, and under-appreciated my entire sales career. I decided to do something about it, and today I signed an offer 2.5x my current salary.",397,7rkxo0,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7rkxo0/30_days_ago_i_decided_that_im_done_being/,66,"Hi all,

Long time lurker, first time poster here. I wanted to share my story and also say THANK YOU to /r/jobs as much of my recent epiphanies were the result of information posted here and throughout reddit. I'm beyond excited and a bit shocked right now, so I apologize in advance if I ramble at all.

I've always struggled with understanding my self-worth as a sales professional, and as a result I've been underpaid, overworked, and under-appreciated for most of my 6+ years in sales. I tend to get complacent and comfortable, which leads me to just go through the daily motions and collect my paycheck every two weeks without ever really considering what else might be out there. I don’t like rocking the boat unless it’s necessary.

I've been with my current company for over 3 years. I've been compensated at 40k base and roughly 5-10k in year commission/bonuses. It's a small company and, frankly, I do love working here. The people are great, we are all very close and the majority of them have been here longer than me -- a testament to the great culture. My boss is extremely easy going and flexible.... but he's also very hands off which has led to me not receiving any form of raise or promotion during my tenure. It's not that I'm performing poorly and don't deserve one; rather he and I are both fairly introverted and there is no clear process in-place for requesting a raise/promotion. Not being entirely confident in my own self-worth, I've avoided initiating that conversation in the hope that he eventually would, but it just never happened.

On my 3 year anniversary I decided that I need to know where I stand, and so I scheduled a time to meet with my boss. We had a good conversation but he deflected that he would need approval first and that he would let me know within a week or two.

Not being entirely satisfied with that answer I decided to do something I absolutely hate doing and entertain some recruiter calls and outside opportunities / interviews. I used to hate interviewing because, frankly, I was terrible at it. I didn't have experience to speak to, I didn't have specific examples to speak to, and I wasn't confident enough in my abilities or worth to sell myself efficiently. But I’ve always typically been unemployed when job searching, and therefore a bit desperate….. and that was the quintessential difference this time. I wasn’t desperate at all. I liked my company and if I found something better, great… if not, I knew I’d be okay.

I checked a box on my linekdin profile (which is very well put together over many years of using linkedin) to “let recruiters know you are open” and within a week I had 10 or so recruiters I was speaking with regarding various opportunities. Since I wasn’t desperate I was able to (essentially) interview them about the position and then disqualify ones that didn’t seem right for me. After about a week of this I was able to narrow it down to about 3 companies, and I found that – again, because I was employed and felt secure/comfortable in my current role – that my interviews were actually going great, were much more of an organic, natural conversation than a situation to get nervous about, and that everyone I was speaking to seemed interested in what I had to offer. I was a bit taken aback by the response, to be honest, and I started to wonder why I hadn’t done this sooner!

Fast forward to today and I received two offers, one from the company I was most interested in and that I’m about to sign. The offer is for 6 figures and roughly 2.5x my current salary before even taking into account commission – with a better product that I’m more interested in and passionate about, and better benefits/perks as well. I’m beyond ecstatic -- and also a bit nervous about putting in my two weeks at a company that has been like a second family to me for the last 3 years and that I enjoyed working at – but there is just no way I could possibly turn down this offer and no way that my company would be able match it either.

I did end up receiving a raise here as well for $8,000.00 but it’s just too little too late. The thing is, I’ve received linkedin messages from recruiters before this promising 6 figure salaries and I’ve always ignored them. I simply didn’t think it was possible for me to make that kind of jump. I disqualified myself because my own self-evaluation was way off after being stuck in low paying sales jobs for many years, and looking back I wish I had been more proactive about ALWAYS being open to new opportunities as they present themselves.

It's my hope that someone in a similar situation to me will read this and decide to take a chance too.

What I learned and was reinforced from this experience....

-ALWAYS be looking and open to talking with recruiters about new opportunities. You never know what else is out there until you try.

-DON’T disqualify yourself from a position just because the pay-rate is intimidating to you. Taking risks will pay off in the long-run and it’s never a waste of time to explore your options.

-DO NOT wait till you are fired or quit to start looking for a new job. Being employed will give you leverage and make the entire process more approachable and less stressful.

-APPROACH all interviews like any other sales call or conversation with someone you just met. You have NOTHING to be nervous about so relax, be yourself, study beforehand, and make sure you like the company and opportunity as well. It's a two way street.

tl;dr – Never thought I would be able to land a job that pays more than the 40k I was making. After 3 years of no raise, I decided to see what else was out there. 1 month later I’m signing a 6 figure offer letter that’s 2.5x my current salary, all because I decided to take a chance and talk to some recruiters on Linkedin – who I had ignored in the past because I didn’t think I was worth it.",1516419861.0,2018-01-19 22:44:21

523,"23. Unemployed. One year out of University, cant get a career or even a job going. How screwed am I with Covid-19?",397,gm4cmq,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gm4cmq/23_unemployed_one_year_out_of_university_cant_get/,123,"A bit of background:

Im a 23 y/o Female and I only have ever worked casually (high school through to March this year). I worked in retail all through uni. Due to the economy here in Australia (im talking before covid19), I struggled to also get the hours I wanted in these casual positions as a 18-22 year old and probably wasnt the best worker due to my mental health issues. I tried so hard though.

From Jan-March this year I worked in administration for a not for profit. This role was only 15 hours a week and I only got it through nepotism (spent a bit under a year volunteering in that role beforehand). In this admin role, I was told that they couldnt pay me when the manager returned from her trip that was cancelled due to Covid-19, and thats why I left in March (Laid off I guess). They didnt explicitly state if it was due to not actually being able to justify my role or simply Corona-virus. I had a casual contract till Dec 2020 in this role.  I was disappointed because I found the work easy and they constantly ask me to do work for them now (Im still volunteering for them).

Anyway thats a bit of background.

Im struggling to find work in my field and I just dont know what to do. Ive suffered from serve anxiety and depression since I was in highschool.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce, in International Relations and Legal Studies, with a distinction average (mid 70s average mark). The Legal Studies side is basically like 'qualifications' in legal secretary work. However, I found out too late its extremely difficult to get into legal admin work without connections. International Relations is an arts major, but the majority of my high achieving class mates are now working in grad roles for high level government departments or international organisations etc. Due to my legal studies major, I could do a J.D Law Degree in 2 years if I wanted to, but I dont really want to be a lawyer, plus Australia is super saturated with unemployed lawyers who hold average intelligence.

I found it hard to put in applications while I was finishing at uni, but between July last year (when i graduated) and November 2019, I put in about 100 applications.  70 of those would of been relevant positions to my degree. Of those 70, I had about 5 face to face interviews and about 2 phone interviews. All obviously weren't successful. A lot of these positions I couldn't get past the psychometric testing part of the application process (when they were graduate roles)

(I applied to a broad range of graduate programs in both the public and private sector- to entry level admin/sales/support positions i could use as a stepping stone.) I know its not alot, but most people with the same degree havent had this issue, and my anxiety was so bad after I while, I admit I gave up.

I stopped applying when I landed a Christmas retail position I working in up to 50 hours a week- then i moved onto the nepotism admin role in Jan. Ive been applying again from Jan this year but no Luck. Then Coronavirus hit and I just have been ignoring the entry level roles now because everyone is on a hiring freeze and focusing on graduate programs which would start next year.

Things I want to mention/clarify

1. Ive had my CV/Resume run over about 5 times with a career councillor. They think its pretty good so im not sure what else I can do. I ustilise the S.T.A.R method to demonstrate my experience/volunteering etc on my CV. Its two pages long, which is normal in Australia for graduates.
2. I  dont have an internship under my belt. I tried very hard to get an internship, literally got one in my last semester, they said 'you can start on Monday"" -then I  got a call four hours later saying they could'nt give me the internship after all. The 'big boss' didnt think he could run me through the ropes or something before he left for a holiday.. Im not sure if this was just an excuse, but this was for a professional partisan Industry chamber lol. It blew my confidence massively.
3. I have 2 years experience in 2 volunteering roles. Basically event management/fundraising and supporting refugees and migrants integrate/learn English.
4. I write each individual cover letter from scratch to suit the companies needs/utilise key words. Every, single time no matter the role.
5. Im not picky. I realise at my age, I can try anything or any industry. I just want to get my foot in the door. Like I said, I have applied to 'very top' graduate government roles- to local council admin job roles- to entry level admin jobs for small businesses to KPMG, EY etc.

I honestly think Im just a dumbass, and I will never be able to land a full time job. If I cant make it past most of the psychometric testing in these graduate jobs, it must be true, right?

Also because of my anxiety, a lot of the positions Im too afraid to apply for.  I look at the skills and experience and I freak out. An admin role asking for 3 years experience? Forget about it. I've realised I dont actually have many solid technical skills, despite, obviously a pretty much worthless degree and vague transferable skills.

Its so disheartening. Im really not sure what I should do. None of my close friends went to uni, are unemployed or work in completely different industries. My dad is a mechanic and my mum has been a home-maker for 30 years.

What should I do? Should I continue to apply for graduate roles, or focus on very low level admin/business/sales roles and go from there?

I received an automated email and text message from a company that advertised themselves as a marketing agency called ""School Haus"" ([weareschoolhaus.com](https://weareschoolhaus.com)). I thought it was strange because I never once applied or even looked at their website and was confused how they got my information (figured it out later that it was via Zip Recruiter).

&#x200B;

Looking at their website it immediately looked off - stock image photos, no job descriptions, no client list, no names of anyone on the team and automated messages from HR. I was not interested in their company but decided to schedule an interview anyway even just for practice. Once I did further research however, and googled their address I came across these two links:

* [https://tamzarianarmin2.wordpress.com/tag/690-8th-avenue-5th-floor/](https://tamzarianarmin2.wordpress.com/tag/690-8th-avenue-5th-floor/)

&#x200B;

After doing further investigative research, I realized this was a complete Pyramid Scheme under the umbrella of Credico. There's even a short documentary exposing them called the ""[Sweatshop of Wall Street](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn84yuWSki0&feature=youtu.be)"". There are tons of small companies under this umbrella so please beware!!! A lot of marketing jobs you will come across on Zip Recruiter, Indeed or even LinkedIn might share the same address (**690 8th Avenue**). I've already found a few more more: [Allure Marketing Group](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Allure-Marketing-Group-Reviews-E721504.htm),  [W.U.G Marketing](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/W-U-G-Marketing-Reviews-E977967.htm) and [Adrian-Martin Acquisitions](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Adrian-Martin-Acquisitions-Reviews-E1318630.htm) all with the same address. Honestly reading through the interview reviews at those places is pretty funny if you just want a good laugh.

&#x200B;

If you see any ""Entry Level Marketing Associate"" positions for immediate hire do your research! Look them up on GlassDoor and LinkedIn - check their reviews; if there are an excess amount of generic 5 star reviews and an excess amount of 1-star reviews, the 5-star reviews are most definitely fake.

&#x200B;

Tl;dr - If you come across an entry level marketing associate position at **690 8th avenue** it's most definitely a pyramid scheme and a door-to-door sales job. Do you research before accepting interviews!

Do you think it's significant?",400,blz3ac,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/blz3ac/underemployment_is_barely_ever_mentioned_in_this/,268,"Browsing through any news sites you'll see on the front reports of the wonderful performance of the economy, with mentions of great job growth and low unemployment rates. Browsing through any subeditor and it's full praise. But how do you think it reflects the actual reality and economic conditions of people?

I've seen an almost endless opportunity of low end low pay jobs with high turnover (or not). But regardless it's not exactly clear how much of these jobs pay dignified living wages. An economy with low unemployment but large proportion of the jobs are low paying, and part time, doesn't signify something positive.   


The economy seems to be doing great, but hearing from the impression of people, and actually applying for jobs, the wages seem still poor - in relation to living costs and inflation. High paying career oriented jobs are highly competitive, you often have to compete with hundreds of people to land these jobs.   


I mean yes I could go join one of the new jobs added that pay 10 dollars an hour and be considered employed - but is that really meaningful? I just don't buy it. Employers are still as picky as every and the ones that struggle is because they offer awful wages, awful conditions, no benefits. Usually these are the places that struggle to retain workers and have high turnover, but they usually get away with it so they don't care.  


Basically, yes more jobs, less unemployment. Though wages are still poor, working conditions haven't really improved, and the quality of these jobs are questionable.",1557307261.0,2019-05-08 05:21:01

I'm a 25 year old at the beginning of my career and I'm starting to feel like working too efficiently is actually a bad thing. Everyday (particularly when I first started this job), I would come into work and feverishly tackle all of my tasks in the most efficient way possible. Eventually, this led to me finishing my tasks way faster than my peers who were doing the same amount of work, but spreading it throughout the whole day by taking breaks, surfing reddit, or staring blankly into space.

Of course, I thought this would lead to greatness, but actually it seems to have caused me trouble. Because I finish earlier, I constantly end up having to take on other people's work and help them. I didn't mind this when people seemed appreciative (or my boss recognized that I was going above and beyond), but now it just seems like I'm expected to do it.

Perhaps the worst part, though, is that I usually leave at 5ish because I've finished everything. My coworkers end up leaving at 6 or later because they still have work that they procrastinated on. Because of this, it looks like they're working harder/longer (especially because my boss seems to value how long you sit at your desk over how much work you actually get done).

Hi sub, first post here. I've been searching for a new job in my field in a different part of the country from where I live, my family has been wanting to move back bear where we grew up. So after 5 months of applying and being ghosted after the first round of phone interviews I finally got two requests for me to fly out to meet both companies for in person interviews.

I took off work and flew out to meet them, set one up for Wednesday morning and the other for the afternoon. The morning interview at company A went ok but I was not that excited for the job, they told me they had two more interviews and would let me know.

After lunch I drove across town to company B and their world headquarters. After having a 3 hour marathon of meetings with HR, the VP of Operations and the person who would be my department head. By the time we finished up it was EOB but we both thought it would be a good fit an they invited me to come in and shadow the team I would be in charge of the next day.

I arrived at 10 am Thursday and spent time with the team, even had a few of them already calling me boss man. Right before lunch time the department head came down to check in and said that I could stay if I want but they were putting  together an offer for me that would meet everything I was asking for including a bonus to relocate! and that I could come by on Friday to make it all official, but didn't give me many details.

After lunch I called company A to tell them to take me off the list and called the wife to tell her the good news and to start working on getting a transfer at her job. 

My flight was scheduled to leave at 1 pm, so I arrived at 8 am presumably to meet with HR and sign an offer sheet. I checked in with security and told them I had a meeting with Mrs. HR. He said she was not in today I would have to reschedule. I asked him then to see if Mr. Dept head was available, the guard picked up the called him up and after telling him I was here said ""I'll let him know"". Then tell me ""Sir your not allowed on the premises I'm going to have to ask you to leave"". 

Excuse me what?

I leave to go to my car and tried calling HR and DH but both were not answering, and after a few minutes of searching I found the number for the VP in the bottom of my interview email chain, so I blocked my number and called him on his extension. Barely did I get out ""Hi this is u/greatlarrybird33"" before she hung up on me.

What the hell, there is nothing in my background that could have popped up, hell I haven't even gotten a ticket in 15 years. I don't know anyone at the company other than my contacts. 

I can live with ghosting me after a phone call, but after I've spent $1200 on airfare and a hotel plus 3 days of personal time used. What the hell man, I don't get companies. Think they will pay up if I send them a bill?

My dad had a Skype interview for a pharmaceutical representative position last week. He is in his mid-50s, currently laid off, but has decades of experience as a pharmaceutical sales rep in his country (he immigrated to Canada with my mom before I was born), and up until a few months ago, several years of experience in the position in Canada. I was in the next room, so I could hear the interview through our paper-thin walls. The interviewer overall came off as rude, telling my dad repeatedly to “sum it up” and “I don’t have time for this”. Then, at the end of the interview, she asked whether my dad had any questions for her. He asked, “What are your company’s core values?” She asked “what?” My dad repeated the question, to which she replied “Learn to speak English, alright?” And ended the interview. 
I am still shaking with anger writing this now. He just got the news that he didn’t get the job (as to be expected). The interviewer is the Head Director of a pretty large pharmaceutical company, so his chances of applying elsewhere in the same company has been cut. I don’t think she was professional, and I am almost certain it violates some code of ethics. My dad agrees, and he wants to do something about the incident but isn’t sure of his options. Is there anything my dad can do to take next steps? Or should he just let it go?

TL;DR My dad was insulted for his accent in an interview and we don’t know whether further action needs to be taken.

Finally got an offer after 8 months

I was unemployed for 8 months and 8 days to be exact. Haven’t had a real job in 2020 besides helping my dads business but that wasn’t a long term solution for me. I was pivoting industries to sports business before covid and took a 4 month contract role that ended in December. I was in the middle of 2 interview processes in March that we’re promising but halted due to covid. Very bad/unlucky timing in hindsight.

I was determined to stay in this industry. I have an MBA and really didn’t expect to be one of the people who struggled to find a job. This was a shot to my character and mental toughness and truly humbled me. This grueling 8 months was a major reality check and makes me so grateful for this opportunity. 

I will say I wouldn’t have been able to do it without some resume and interview guidance from this sub and honestly the extra UI benefits/pandemic relief really helped financially. 

My takeaways:

1. The grind is worth it 

2. You can get rejected hundreds of times, it takes 1 company/opportunity for it to all be worth it. 

3. Create your own luck! I often would say “my buddy is so lucky to have this sick job why can’t that be me?” but he/she probably worked even harder than I have to get it so your luck comes with how much effort you put in.

Thank you to everyone who took the time and even calculated detailed expenses and wrote elaborate responses. I will try to respond to everyone as soon as I can. I genuinely appreciate all the support. I know we're all a bunch of random people on the internet but I wish you all the best. Some of these responses gave me the boost I needed. 


I recently accepted an offer for this $17 hourly paid call center job because I had bills I needed to start paying after being unemployed for a year. I was very anxious to start doing anything and unemployment really took a toll on my mental health and self confidence. I understand my market is currently struggling and I shouldn’t feel this way. 

My previous role (which I really liked) was a technical business analyst role (60k salary + benefits) which I secured after graduating with my Bachelors and had a lot more responsibility than my role now. That BA role went through a restructure and I was fired after my boss quit.  For this new call center role, I have been here a month and I already feel like I don’t belong. I would like to be here no longer than 6 months while I look else where. I’m also fairly burned out from the job search and trying to find ways to network instead to blindly submitting applications.

My primary concern is the effect my coworkers will have on my outlook when networking with others. It seems judgemental but everyone here is severely financially irresponsible and not in a place that I would like to be in emotionally, health-wise and psychologically. For example, there’s been comments made about how micromanagement is not a big deal and you should expect to hear from your manager if you’re a minute late back from 30 min lunch. At the same time, it’s nice to have somebody to talk to after being unemployed.

I’m also concerned with losing a 1.58 PTO monthly accrual to interviews. How do I filter interviews?

Did I mention that I have to drive 72 miles one way to work this job? With bills, I’m barely able to scratch even so this job is definitely not sustainable.

On a positive note, my shift starts at 10AM so at least I have time in the morning to interview and get things done.

I feel trapped. What is the smartest thing I can do to get out of this job into a more sustainable situation? How can I explain to recruiter or future HR why I’m leaving a job after being fired from one?

Unfortunately, the reality is for most applications, if you haven't heard anything from the organization, it most likely means someone else is the preferred candidate and at best you're the backup. 


I'm sure people will anecdotally say different, or have one-off stories where they suddenly heard back and were hired after weeks of radio silence, and there are exceptions to the rule, but most of the time that will not be the case. 


Hiring is a 2-way street, recruiters and hiring managers want to hire someone. If they have a candidate they like and want, they don't want that person to get away. As such, they don't leave that person hanging for 2 or 3 weeks with radio silence. Instead they keep in touch, maintain a relationship, and ultimately hire that person. They don't want the person thinking they missed out and move on. 


I bring this up because too many people torment themselves, myself included, hoping and wishing that they'll get the call for that job they applied/interviewed for weeks ago. 


We think things like: 


* I haven't been rejected yet so I still have a chance! 


* They said they would contact me either way so I must still be in the running!


Sadly the harsh reality is, if you're not the preferred candidate, you're not worth anything to them. You're an after thought and they might eventually send a regrets email, but again, you're not worth anything to them, so they don't really care to spend the time communicating with you. 


Ultimately the best thing to do after an application is forget about it after applying. There's no value to hanging on and hoping that you'll one day get a call because if you haven't heard anything it's most likely a no. There's no sense torturing yourself, crossing your fingers, and refreshing your email for the 100th time that hour. Just move on, clear your head, and be better for it. At worst you correctly mentally move-on and you get rejected as expected and it didn't cost you anything. You don't curse them out or anything, you just move-on as if you've been rejected, and don't spend time torturing yourself hoping that ""today's the day.""


**TL;DR:** If an organization wants you they'll be responsive and communicative. They want to hire someone so they don't want their preferred candidates to get away. If you haven't heard anything from an organization in a few weeks, it's most likely a no and it's time to move on.",1601957153.0,2020-10-06 00:05:53

553,4+ months of job hunting and I finally landed a job in NYC!,387,dcbe5c,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dcbe5c/4_months_of_job_hunting_and_i_finally_landed_a/,22,"Hi guys, I just wanted to say thank you to this sub and r/resumes for helping me be confident in my job hunt for this long. 

Backstory: I moved to NYC with my bf for his job without having one here myself so I started sending out resumes and filling out applications for everything related to my previous job (business/project analysis). Everyone told me I wouldn't have a problem finding a job in NYC because there are so many opportunities for my field... Fast-forward a couple months and day after day I am getting anxious and depressed after a lot of dead-ends and ghosting from employers. It really started taking a toll on my mental health. I didn't want to leave my apartment in fear of spending money that I wasn't currently making, and I hated going to social gatherings and answering the inevitable ""So what do you do?"" question 10x a night with ""I'm currently looking, something will come up eventually"".

My tips and experience job hunting: Finally I decided to get help from r/resumes. I drastically changed some formatting issues and tailored my resume to show my achievements at my last company while highlighting some outdated processes that I helped improve, which I think made a huge difference. I also started learning the basics of MS SQL and Python language since my last job was limited to running analysis and reporting with Access & Excel. So my tip would be to learn another skill that can help you in your field. Even if its just a basic understanding so that you know the terminology or how that skill can be used in your desired career. After \~400 applications (on Indeed and LinkedIn) I then got 10-15 phone interviews. Phone interviews do so much for improving your confidence in yourself. When you're feeling down and get scheduled for a phone call, you start to feel instantly better (albeit nervous too). So schedule and answer all the phone interviews you can. Over the 4+ months of searching I had only 5 on-site interviews. There are lots of good discussions on here about what to do for an on-site interview. I found being confident in how you are presenting yourself throughout is the key. Dress nice, be kind, speak with confidence about your successes and your knowledge in your field.. and the biggest tip I have when speaking about yourself is to BE DETAILED. Employers don't like general statements. They are trying to find out how much you know and how you can help them. When you start being vague and general, it comes off as you trying to fake what you know.

555,How I used LinkedIn to take my response rate from 1/50 to 1/5,384,4t5lvp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4t5lvp/how_i_used_linkedin_to_take_my_response_rate_from/,37,"Like many people here I'm looking for my first 'real' job after college and I've been on the hunt for several months now. I sent out hundreds of boilerplate resumes on Indeed and CareerBuilder and got maybe a dozen responses and two or three phone interviews, none of which led anywhere. I'm not sure what exactly clicked for me, but about 3 weeks ago I decided I'd had enough, and that I was going to do everything in my power to stop being unemployed.

**TL;DR**: Tailor every resume you send out with all specific keywords from the description, LinkedIn message recruiters at the companies you apply to, follow up with everyone

**Step one: overhaul your resume**, and send a specifically-tailored version to every job you apply for. There's a reason people keep giving this advice over and over. A week ago I messaged a recuiter for a status update on my application and she told me my resume had been filtered out because it didn't include the keyword 'Outlook' - I had said 'advanced experience with Microsoft Office', but since I didn't mention Outlook specifically she had never even seen my resume. If the job description says ""Proficient with MS Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)"", then copy and paste that into your resume. 

My process is this: find a job I want to apply for, open up my master resume file (it's 2 pages long with about 25 bullet points I can whittle down), open a blank notepad file and copy & paste the job description, then copy each point from the notepad file into my resume to make sure I hit every keyword and phrase verbatim, then take out any bullet points that weren't needed. This leaves me with a single-page resume that I know will make it through their filtering software.

**Step two: LinkedIn**

* Make a professional-looking profile if you don't have one already. Put on a shirt and tie and take a good photo, look up profiles of people in your industry to use as inspiration for your headline and description, follow some groups in your industry, etc.

* After you apply for a job, google the phrase ""site:linkedin.com [company you applied for] [city the job is in] recruiter OR HR OR talent"" and find somebody (or multiple people) who works in their recruiting dept. 

* Send them a connection request with something along the lines of ""Hi, I recently applied for [job title] with your company and wanted to reach out to the recruiter for this position and ask you to join my professional network on LinkedIn. -[your name]""

* If they accept, I send them this message:

> Hi,

> Thanks for connecting with me! As I said I recently applied for the [job title] position in [city] listed by your company and saw that you were on their HR team, so I wanted to reach out and introduce myself. As you'll see from my resume I have a bachelor's in [field] and I am currently looking for a career that will allow me to get a foot in the door in the [industry] industry. In a word I'm a smart guy and a hard worker, and would appreciate any advice you could offer for navigating your company's hiring process, as this position seems like a good fit with both my skills and professional goals.

> Thanks for your time and I hope to hear back soon,

> [your name]

> PS - If someone else is handling the hiring for this position, I'd appreciate it if you could pass along their contact info so I can express my enthusiasm directly. Thanks!

The point is to get your name in front of them, so that when they think about that position they automatically think of you. Persistence is not the same as annoying people. It's their job to hire the right person for the job, and by reiterating your interest you're showing that you're willing to put in more effort than simply sending a resume. Often they will message back thanking me for reaching out and ask to set up a phone interview. Other times they'll ask for clarification about my experience. Sometimes they'll say it's not the right fit, but they'll keep me in mind for future positions. In any of the three cases I'm better off than I would have been had I not messaged them.

**Step Three: Follow up.**

 I make calendar events in my phone for everything so I don't forget. Message them again in a week to ask if there's been any progress/ if anything new has come up that they think might be a good fit. This stuff doesn't come naturally to me. My gut tells me not to bother them, that if they want to contact me they can, but doing what comes naturally obviously isn't working, and being persistent is working (I have an Excel spreadsheet with the data to prove it). A short two sentence message once a week isn't pestering anybody; it's showing an active interest, which is a desirable trait.

Looking through my phone I had 4 phone interviews this week, and I already have 2 more scheduled for early next week. It's up to you how active a job seeker you want to be, but this stuff works, and I wanted to share it with you guys who I know are every bit as frustrated with unemployment as I am.

I used to work in specialized field as an civil engineer with overlapping electronic skills and because that was my hobby I became very good at it. So since I was unique at the company and could understand the electronic side and civil side of a project, I didn't have anyone else working with me on those types of projects. 

After I resigned and was in my notice period they never hired a replacement for me and I left and have not looked back. I started my own consulting company and been trying to get that going. I got a call from my old manager today asking if the new engineer can contact me and I can explain to him how to collect data etc. I didn't really give them an answer but this is not normal right? They want me just to explain everything over the phone to the new guy.

Everything I learnt at the company I did by mostly by myself because no one else was doing it here. I contacted international experts and ran simulations myself to understand the data that we work with and improved my skills. I feel that if they want me to train someone months after I left, I should get paid. I want to tell them that there must hire me as a consultant for the day and I will come train the new guys. Does that sound unreasonable? I really don't know if that is a good idea because although I never want to work for them again, it feels like might be burning a bridge.

TL;DR A company that I resigned from last year wants me train my replacement months later and I feel that they should pay me to do the training. ",1553582215.0,2019-03-26 02:36:55

Also wondering if anyone has been through anything similar. It’s a bit lengthy so sorry about that, but here goes... 

I’ve been unemployed since I graduated in May. Submitted tons of applications to no avail. Finally I get a response from two firms, get interviews, and get both jobs. I picked one because it was remote (or so I was told) and paid more. I researched the company beforehand and while there were some strange things (the way it was described online was different from what I was told), it seemed very legitimate and ultimately had good reviews. EDIT: the other job also seems shady now that I’ve looked into it so no major loss there at least  

At no point during any of my communications with the team was I told this job would require in person meetings. I was explicitly told it was remote on multiple occasions (always over the phone or video though). I find out literally the day before I’m supposed to start that they expect us to meet at a certain location, and only give us an hour to get there (since there is remote work to be done beforehand). The location is a two hour commute from me- even if by some chance I missed the fact that there were supposed to be in person meetings (which I highly doubt I would’ve missed), I certainly would not have missed the location. 

I reached out to the supervisor seeking clarification, and she was not at all kind about this- she insisted that she had mentioned this and blamed me entirely. I think I’d have to be the biggest idiot in the world to have missed the fact that I’m supposed to make a two hour commute in one hour, and I think the words “fully remote position” aren’t really up for interpretation, but sure. I also suspect they lied about the salary, because the paperwork suggests something entirely different from what I was told in the interview. In the interview I was promised a base salary and then part commission- but with the new hire paperwork I received a contract saying I would agree to work fully on commission.

So now, I’m pretty much lost. I was depressed earlier for being unemployed, so getting a job was a saving grace. I felt like I was finally getting my life together. Now that’s all gone. So when you’re interviewing for a job just be smarter than me I guess... 

TLDR: I finally got a job after months of unemployment, found out the day before I was due to start that the conditions for the job were totally different than what I was told, had no choice but to quit, and am now depressed about returning back to square one",1603713028.0,2020-10-26 07:50:28

It's a 30% increase in base salary, and almost 60% increase in total compensation if sales organization numbers are hit. Considering the increase in money it feels like a no brainer. However here are my issues:

**Job security:**

* I'm leaving a steady, publicly listed company for a ""Early Stage Venture""
   * New job was founded in 2010.
      * Total of $28M in funding over 3 rounds. Their latest funding was raised on Jan 28, 2018 from a Series B round.
* Is this a good time to switch jobs with Covid and resulting economic fall out?

**Leaving behind valuable relationships:**

* I have great relationships with very senior management. I have great relationships with senior sales. And have a great relationship with my team and my personal team manager.
* It does feel like in the very long run I should be able to leverage these into... something?

I would say those are my two biggest issues. I think both roles have the opportunity for growth and learning new skills. I have a call tomorrow with the global head of sales for my current job and I'm expecting some sort of counter offer. I doubt they will match, but it's an opportunity to negotiate my current salary, role, and responsibilities.

I like my current job, but I'm definitely underpaid and over worked to a degree. Am I crazy for thinking about turning down such a large increase in compensation because of the fears listed above?

There are many reasons leading to my eventual decision of leaving my current job

During COVID they put people into working at home. Had system issues for months causing me to drop calls. I reported this for months. Call center manager pulled me from the phones and said that if this continues, he’s putting me back on-site. As if I did anything to purposely drop calls. Another girl had the same issue but she was written up and banned from going to work at home. 

Fast forward back on site. NO ONE is wearing a mask at work and it’s not mandated. I had to move seats constantly because someone thinks it’s a good idea to sit next to you with no mask and even cough next to you. I complained to the company about it and I even complained to the union. Even the union doesn’t want to do anything about it. 

The major issue with these onsite computers is that half of them don’t work. When I moved to a seat it was working at first, but when I returned from lunch, I found it off and couldn’t be back on. I had to scramble to the new computer. I had to clock back in late and later get an infraction despite proof that I attempted to log into the phone system and the automatic clock in system on time. I had to dispute it with my manager for 2 weeks only to find that apparently “it’s valid.”

I worked 2x the hours as the owner, held the majority of project responsibilities, yet raises came less and time off was almost impossible to come by. All the while, I was still receiving negative feedback constantly and being micromanaged to death.

After a year of anxiously thinking about giving my notice, I found a different job opportunity that sounded amazing, so I gave my two weeks. My boss took it about as well as he could considering he's losing his only employee. For a bit I felt bad, because despite my gripes, I did become relatively close to him and there were parts of working there I loved. But the longer my decision sinks in, the more free I feel.

It's an amazing feeling, like a new lease on life. After my two weeks, my spouse and I are going on a week long vacation, and then I get to start my new job fresh and relaxed when we get back. 

I wish I would have done this sooner, because the mental distress I put up with was draining. But hot damn am I actually excited for my future!

I know such shifts aren’t unheard of in fields like medicine, but I’m an engineer (and also salaried) so this is the first time I’ve heard of something like this. And to boot, they gave me absolutely zero notice about this. 

I’m at a job site all day today doing some inspections and got a text from another engineer at 7AM this morning. From their text, they now expect me to also work a night job doing the same thing from 8 to 5 am later tonight. 

I already told them I can’t do this, and after I finish up here I’m driving straight to my office to try and talk with my boss about more realistic expectations. But I’m still flabbergasted someone would even think it’s okay to ask someone to work such hours with no notice. 

Has anyone else ever had to deal with these kind of unrealistic expectations? Any tips on best ways to handle a conversation with my boss?

EDIT/UPDATE: After a second discussion with my boss, he hesitantly agreed to set a limit to the time I'm in the field. From next week, he said I won't have any more 12-hour shifts let alone people asking me to work for 24+ hours between multiple job sites. 

Its now a waiting game to see if/how long this promise lasts. I imagine he and the other engineer who schedules me may fall back into the trend of trying to get me to work these long days. I'm feeling the physical repercussions of being in the field full-time this week (even without that hellish 24-hour shift), so I might find myself resigning over the next couple of weeks regardless.",1560381462.0,2019-06-12 19:17:42

I'm 28 years old I have 8 years of work experience the jobs I had in the past were dead end. During my last job as a store assistant I really enjoyed helping customers and doing in-store visual merchandising and promotions coming up with creative ways to attract people to the store. 

At the time I finally had enough savings to go back to school so I figured marketing is something I should persue. I graduated in May of last year in marketing management with a distinction, however during my time in college as I progressed studying it more I realised that marketing is not something I can see myself doing, but I kept denying this feeling thinking it will get better until my final year I was literally just forcing myself to get this degree done with no passion.  

I love doing visual art and creating things that people find appealing to look at. Art has always been a passion of mine, but you know when you listen to your parents or other people they say there's no money in it and you have to do something that's going to financially secure you. I should have not listen to them. 

Ever since graduating I applied everywhere even while I was still studying got a couple of interviews, but still no luck. I figured maybe I suck at interviewing so I took the initiative to work on my interviewing skills.

Went on more interviews which I thought went well, but still receiving the ""Unfortunately"" or ""We regret to inform you"" e-mails. This morning I just received another rejection e-mail. I think they are sensing the lack of passion and disinterest I have for marketing. 

I am in desperate need of a job and family members are pressuring and judging me which does not help. I'm so burned out and depressed from this literally putting my time and energy into trying to find a job I have no interest in anymore...

I even applied for retail and fast food restaurant jobs just to get my family off my back, but i'm still waiting on a response. 

My plan now is to figure out a way to get into graphic designing I know that is something that would be more suitable for me, but I have no qualification or portfolio and have no money to study it... I am in need of advice on what to do.

Super-employable from my perspective.

I guarantee you that people have not stayed because my workplace is a good one. I know I'm not the only one at my job that would head for the exit as soon as I could. Details aren't really necessary because it's all the typical stuff that makes people hate their job and want to quit.

First off, I'm sorry if this isn't the place for this, if anyone could direct me to where this would be more appropriate, please do so!

&#x200B;

In 2018, I graduated with a degree in supply chain, job search was extremely hard but somehow I landed an inventory planner role at a small-mid food/trading company. Now this job was a disaster for me. There wasn't any kind of onboarding that allowed me to be acquainted with the operations of the company, I was given so much information and responsibilities that I could not retain everything, and it seemed like I was asking very stupid questions. My excel skills was very subpar at the time too, I never learned more beyond the excel I used at school. I had to google to learn how to do things on Excel on the job and the manager was very frustrated at me and he told me point blank that ""I thought you graduated from a good business school, what happened? Did you lie about your credentials?"" I was flabbergasted. He handed me a supply chain for dummies book and told me to study it, and it hurt my self worth a lot. I WAS passionate about supply chain and still retained a lot of things I learned at school, however I thought it was okay to not remember/know everything and that you would learn on the job?

&#x200B;

Anyway, after a week, I knew that place couldn't be for me and we mutually decided to part ways as I knew he'd let me go sooner or less. Job search after that became even harder than it was before, I felt worthless and unconfident to start a career in supply chain, I went on so many interviews and failed to secure a position in the field. I am now working in an unrelated career path. It's a humble career, but I feel like I could do more with myself and get paid a lot more, especially since I have a double major in supply chain and information systems. But the thing is, that ""first"" job greatly traumatizes me to this day and I feel like I could never be good to work in an analyst or planner role within supply chain. COVID 19 has really set me back this year as well, I wanted it to be the year where I'd leave my current job and seek a job in supply chain, but right now I care a lot about job security. I don't want to land a job in supply chain and have it end up like my first job, with me having to leave or be let go because I am unqualified.

It really just seems like I was very unlucky in my first job and what happened was not at all my fault. I just need to muster up the courage to start applying everywhere again and realize that any good company will have proper onboarding process and will offer me the support I need to adjust and fit well in the company.",1592176380.0,2020-06-14 19:13:00

Everyone seemed to really like me during the interview, they told me they loved that I was jotting down some notes while they asked questions, and thought I was really thinking and providing good answers.  Heard nothing for a while, then found out an internal candidate got the job and I was pretty crushed.

A few months later I actually got a job somewhere else in the company which was a much better fit thankfully.  I was speaking with my boss who knew about my previous application and asked me if I wanted to know why I didn't get hired.  He told me that all 5 interviewers ranked me as their #1 pick for who to choose.  It went up to the department head and she decided that if they hired the internal candidate, they could eliminate his current role, thus not adding to their payroll at all.  So they went with him instead of having to add me as a new employee.  Also humorously that guy quit about 2 months into the job and I think now they're actually having trouble filling it.

1. It's a numbers game, but not what you think. The conventional wisdom is that you apply like crazy and hope for the best. This isn't true, because honestly, it's what everyone else is doing. Hone in on what you want, or where you want to do it, and drill down via various methods to find what you want. Focus your energy this way.

2. Linkedin is your friend.  This falls under a couple of topics:
   a.  Join groups specific to your field, and participate. Recruiters will post jobs here and nowhere else. Its how you build a professional network. In fact, one software group I'm a member of flamed and unsubscribed someone who dared ask a technical question, since Linkedin is for building a professional network and job hunting.
   b. Watch status updates for contacts on your phone. If someone lists a job (which is how I found mine), contact them and apply. If someone updates they got a job (or updates their profile to indicate their new job) it tells you two things. First, the company they moved to is hiring, and second, the company they left has an opening.  Use this to your advantage.
   c. If you found a job you want (by narrowing your focus), use Linkedin to find someone at the company and get info that way. Ask anyone you know in a hiring position and they'll tell you that they get hundreds if not thousands of applications for a job opening. No one can reasonably get thru all those apps. They want referrals from existing employees.  Use this to help you.

3. Volunteer, Volunteer, Volunteer. EVERY SINGLE TIME I was called on my resume, my volunteer work came up. This means something for recruiters. IF you are out of work, hiring managers want to know what you did with your time off.  Fill it.  Second, I used my volunteer work to round out my skill set, and got real world, practical experience that ultimately led me to be able  to move into a new role in my new position.

4. Join groups that have to do with what you want. Find them on meetup, or thru professional groups and user groups.  Go to meetings and make connections. Again, inside referrals are how you get jobs. The old school way of applying on-line and hoping for a call back is becoming obsolete. Make yourself known to people in your field, even if you are a noob. People will think of you when positions open up.

5. Help other people whenever you can. It will make you feel better about this whole process, and it WILL come in handy eventually. 

6. Never give up. This process was horrific, humiliating, and discouraging for me. I took a break for a couple of weeks to recharge my batteries, because I knew my desperation had to be showing, and I'm sure it was.  A break can do wonders, but do it with an end point in mind  because as heartless as it sounds, no one was going to get me a job but me.  Move forward even though at times its painful.

Ok, sorry for the wall of text.  Good luck redditors. And thank you for helping and comforting me, even tho I haven't been here long.

604,Glad I Didn't Take the Counteroffer,363,8fcrhr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8fcrhr/glad_i_didnt_take_the_counteroffer/,54,"Put in my two weeks notice last week and was prematurely excited to not have to deal with the counteroffer, because I'm a yes person and not comfortable with confrontation.

It turns out that management was looking to move the office to another location that would make my commute an hour longer. So I thought 'sweet, probably no counter offer cause it's a win-win.' 

I was presented with an offer the next day via email. No raise but I could work from home when they finished the move to the new office. Now I really love pajamas and being comfy at home, but I really hate letting people down and I have a new job lined up and ready. I also know (from personal experience and this sub) that shit isn't what it seems. Plus my boss has serious trust issues, I just can't see him suddenly trusting me that I'm doing my job when he can't physically see me. So all that in mind I say thanks but no thanks.

Then I get this little niggly feeling, and I ask a couple days later, hey how's that moving thing going? My boss says 'Oh it's all up in the air and I'm not positive it's going to go through. I might get a freelancer to cover your work but I don't know if I can trust anyone to work from home.' 

Yeah glad I passed on no raise and the thinnest possibility of working from home for a boss that doesn't trust anyone. ",1524873614.0,2018-04-27 20:00:14

Whether you’re a student looking for a part-time job, an electrician seeking work closer to home, or a teacher moving to another state to be close to family, finding a job can be difficult. With job postings scattered across the web, newspapers and help wanted signs, it’s not always easy to find ones that are a good fit based on your unique needs and skills. As a result, many job seekers feel like they can’t find the job they’re looking for or apply to roles that aren’t the right fit. At the same time, 46 percent of U.S. employers face talent shortages and have issues filling open positions with the right candidate. 

At its annual Developers conference Google I/O, Google announced Google for Jobs, a company-wide initiative focused on helping both job seekers and employers, through deep collaboration with the job matching industry. This effort includes the Cloud Jobs API, which provides access to Google’s machine learning capabilities to power smarter job search and recommendations within career sites, jobs boards, and other job matching sites and apps.

606,I Finally Got A Job!!!!!!!!!!!!!,368,k50jrp,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/k50jrp/i_finally_got_a_job/,40,"I (23f) graduated with an environmental engineering degree in May 2020. I did not get to have a grad ceremony due to covid. Covid has also definitely taken its toll on my job search. I have been living back with my parents for nearly 9 months now and have had many many terrible mental health dips. I have been suicidal. And today I officially got email links for the background check and onboarding paperwork for a 6 month opportunity-to-extend full-time job with benefits doing research in my field at a university. It is only $16/hr but that is more than I’ve ever made and I am so thankful for the opportunity to start my post-college journey.

I’m excited but nervous. A lot is riding on this position so it feels like I can’t even experience the relief of getting the “official” offer. I am already planning on where I’m moving once I start getting paid and am more excited about that than anything.

Some advice: ALWAYS send a follow up email after an interview and then again after a decision is made, even if you don’t get the job. If you didn’t get it, ask the interviewer directly what you could improve about yourself or your qualifications or your approach to interviewing. My interviewer reached out to me nearly 2 months after I was rejected for one position I applied for to offer me another. Networking works, apparently.

I’m still treading lightly because I’m scared of some unforeseen thing taking the opportunity away from me. But I am very hopeful which I haven’t been in a long long time. I’m probably starting within the next week or so. Wish me luck!!!",1606906155.0,2020-12-02 05:49:15

Should I complain to HR?,362,atv08d,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/atv08d/boss_insulted_me_after_i_submitted_my_resignation/,106,"A few months back, I went up to the head of the department (let's call him B) and asked him if it is possible to transfer to another section in the SAME department because I wanted career growth (I did NOT ask for a raise/promotion). He was positive and said ""Why not? Eventually you will get promoted"" I was excited and kept going back to him. The third time he told me that ""I tell you what to do NOT you"" I was really taken aback and told him that I was tired of scanning 100 pages a day as I have a graduate degree. This angered him a lot and he said ""the company is not in need of them"" Ever since then, he ignored me and promoted 8 employees in our department except me.

B gave the opportunity to transfer to the other section to my co-worker who's lazy and everybody makes fun of.  He did not give me anything even though my I work hard. The past weeks have been really stressful as both B and the head of the section act as I don't exist and continuously praise my co-worker out loud ""No one like you"" ""You'll do the job better than your co-worker"" 

The place has become so toxic for the past month that I couldn't take it anymore. So I submitted my resignation two days ago (before the bonus). B did not approve it immediately and asked to talk to me. He was so sarcastic during the whole meeting. He asked me if found another job or just going back to sleep. I told him the reason why I quit. He said I was imagining things and am over-sensitive and that I'm having ""schizophrenic thoughts"" thinking I don't understand English well (it's not my native language). He also told me that I'm moody and that he watches me everyday and knows when I will say hi to him or not. When I asked him why I was not transferred, he replied ""If you want something, it doesn't mean you will get it. There's just no business need for you. You just don't understand. You just press buttons. You were part of a problem last year. You know you're so abrasive."" 

I was really shocked and tried to defend myself that he should have notified of my mistakes and that I just wanted to move to another section I did not want a promotion.  He continued ""You know with that attitude, you will never get promoted"" I told him that I have other plans and that's it's not my agenda right now. I also told him that he discriminates against women and asked him why he called me schizophrenic. He became angry and told me to not cause him problems as he did not mean to say ""schizophrenic"" 

He immediately approved my resignation but the problem is that I have to serve one month notice. What should I do? Should I submit a complaint to HR or just let it go?

She lives for drama, bullies her employees, and plays favorites to an absurd degree. Despite this behavior, I have worked under her for close to a year and a half as a temp. My contract ended only 3 months in. Despite HER manager and HR repeatedly telling her that she is going against company policy by not hiring me, she refuses to even so much as talk to me about it. 

I know the reason is because my team includes an employee that she seriously dislikes for petty personal reasons. Because I work closely with this other employee and am friendly with her, she refuses to hire me or even treat us respectfully at all, going so far as to referring to us as a ""clique"" and berating her other employees for acting friendly towards us (for one example, she once bought donuts for the other team under her, and when one of them let my team know there were donuts, she scolded him for including us.) Despite this, I have kept to myself and generally enjoyed my job aside from her. I still work the full 40 hours a week, sometimes more, and receive none of the benefits of other employees, including time off. I also still get paid like a temp, which is NOT a salary that an adult can live off of. I was due a raise in October which, of course, she refused to give me. 

Now, remember I mentioned that even HR has been pressuring her to hire me? Our hiring manager is a really sweet woman. A lot of this has been out of her hands, because she is afraid that by putting too much pressure on my manager, she would actually fire me instead of hire me like they want her to. Recently, another employee reported our manager's behavior to HR, and they are quietly looking in to it and questioning people before deciding what to do. She pulled me aside on Friday, asked me a few questions, etc. At the end of our conversation she told me that there was a regular position open right now in Business Development/Marketing. It would be doing stuff that I like much better than my current job, as it is much more aligned with what I went to school for. It would be under a manager that I'm very friendly with, and one of my friends is on that team, so at company events I tend to sit with all of BizDev/Mktg anyway. I wouldn't say we are all friends by any means, but all of us are friendly and respectful towards each other. Basically it would be the total opposite of where I am now. 

But there is one big con - in order to move forward with the process of applying to this position, I have to tell my manager. It's company policy. Our HR hiring manager offered to tell her on my behalf. However, I'm less afraid of the conversation and more afraid of the possibility that I won't get the job for whatever reason, and that afterwards the treatment from my manager would be even worse. HR told me that our company has a no retaliation policy they are very strict about, but I'm just afraid that wouldn't stop my manager from making my life hell. 

My New Year's resolution was to find a new job. I'm wondering if I should just stay where I am and search for a job outside the company, to avoid potentially stoking the fire of drama with my current manager. 

Or is this risk worth it, and I should move forward? I mean why would HR reach out to me if they didn't think I had a solid chance? And supposedly the manager of that department had even encouraged HR to ask me for my updated resume.

Ugh. I have depression and anxiety, so it's so hard for me to see this situation from a rational perspective. I'd love to hear opinions.",1578938460.0,2020-01-13 13:01:00

Today marks three months since I quit a job that was destroying me inside. In this time, I’ve applied to at least like 50-75 jobs, resulting in 7 final round interviews. Ive left most of them feeling like it went well. The answers I gave during these interviews were for the most part clear concise and applicable, following the STAR format to a tee. I’m confident of that because of how few probing questions my answers seem to provoke. This morning I opened my email to see that, yet again, I have not been selected to fill the role I most recently interviewed for. I genuinely do not know why I’m not getting offers. Based on past experience, I know the difference between when an interview went well and when it went poorly. But now, I am just so confused about what I’m not providing. For the first time today, I’m really feeling scared that I won’t get a job with the salary and benefits I need.

Edit: Also, I wanted to run this past anyone who reads this post. Obviously, when you quit a job it’s going to be the elephant in the room when you begin interviewing for a new one. When asked why I left my old company, I reply with a brief history of my time spent there that basically culminates with “My ambition was to learn a new part of the business after performing well in the same department/same role for 2.5 years. However, it became apparent this was not going to happen in a manner that aligned with my own personal and professional goals, and I did not believe I was going to make much more progress in my current role. Therefore, I decided to explore opportunities outside of the company.” This is an honest accurate answer, but I have suspicion that it is not being received well. Does anyone have any feedback on this?

Edit: This is an unbelievably supportive sub! I am first time poster, but your well measured advice and encouragement has completely snapped me out of my pity party today. Thank you so much everyone.",1554783478.0,2019-04-09 00:17:58

629,What It Takes to Actually Get a Job - An Infographic,360,9tbpyn,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9tbpyn/what_it_takes_to_actually_get_a_job_an_infographic/,103,"Hi there,

I have recently completed a lengthy job search, having received an excellent job offer last week.  I wanted to pass on some valuable information and advice I learned in that search to prospective job seekers on the market now.

To be honest, I really didn't know what I was getting into when I quit my last job and moved across the country.  The last employment search I made out of college took me three months, a few interviews and almost no effort.  This was a completely different story.  I had no experience with such a long period of frustration and disappointment that I endured over the last 6 months.  I've had prospective employers ghost my emails and calls, stand me up for job interviews, and provide virtually no feedback following (what I presumed were) good interviews.  It was emotionally and financially exhausting, to say the least.

The biggest thing I learned from this experience is that searching for a new job is a process.  The simplest analogy I can make is that a job search could be viewed as a maze where you don't have the key.  There are multiple paths you can take to get there, and it takes time to figure out which one works best for you.  The advantage job seekers have is that we can market ourselves differently based upon the position.  You don't have to change your resume for each application -- just have a few variations on hand that are applicable for different skill sets.  As an engineer with experience in production and management, I had separate resumes catered for ""mechanical engineer"", ""manufacturing engineer"", and ""project engineer"", depending on the role I was applying for.  Moreover, don't put all of your eggs in one basket and invest too much time in one position -- the feedback cycle is often the most frustrating part of the search.

Treat each interview as an opportunity to learn as much about the company and position as the interviewers learn about you.  This does two things: 1) it demonstrates your interest in the job and 2) it allows the interviewers to see you as a team member rather than a prospective hire.  Don't monologue it either!  Talking about past accomplishments is great, but if you can't relate that experience to the job requisition or question, it can come across as irrelevant and narcissistic.  During a couple of phone interviews, I came away with a discouraging sense of company policy that made me hesitant to reach out for further consideration -- asking those questions helped me narrow my job search to the jobs I actually wanted.

Don't get frustrated.  This is the hardest thing I had to learn.  Whenever I received a job rejection for a position I applied to, I initially became discouraged.  As time progressed, I came to understand that employers can receive hundreds of applications for each position, and interview a small proportion of those who apply.  Just getting that screening call or interview is a remarkable achievement, and an excellent opportunity to hone your interviewing skills.  Interviews can be uncomfortable and stressful (especially for introverts like me), but like all skills, they can be developed with time and experience.  Over time you'll be able to recognize patterns in interviewing questions, and you should be able to script (not memorize) responses accordingly.  Be prepared to address any lack in qualifications experience in the interview -- they will ask.

For those of you who are curious, in my six month job search, I completed:

\- 356 applications

\- 26 screening calls

\- 18 phone interviews

\- 6 in-person interviews

\- and received 1 job offer.

Hopefully my experience and advice will come of some use to prospective job seekers out there.  If nothing else, my experience should at least normalize the job search for those of you who are currently out there.  Good luck and keep your head up!

632,My new job ruined my job search.,357,cgdui3,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cgdui3/my_new_job_ruined_my_job_search/,127,"This just happened yesterday, so please excuse me if I start to rant.

&#x200B;

About 3 weeks ago, I was technically ""laid off"" from my old job. I had been traveling for the entirety of 2019 up until that point. When the time came and the contract for that position ended I was given the option to either move across the state or continue traveling for long periods of time. I told them that neither of those options were viable and they let me go with a severance package.

&#x200B;

Fortunately, I saw this situation unfolding months ago and started applying for a new job once I realized how this was going to play out. I received a job offer on July 11th and started on the 15th.

&#x200B;

It all seemed too good to be true: higher salary, better commission, control over travel frequency. The company president knew that I had **ZERO** industry experience, but he seemed to like me and was willing to give me a chance to learn the business... Here's the timeline of my brief stint with this company.

&#x200B;

**Thursday (July 11th)-** Job offer

**Monday (July 15)-** Go to the office and sign new hire paperwork

**Tuesday-** Fly to the west coast

**Wednesday to Friday-** Attended one of the industry's largest trade shows

**Saturday-** Fly home and catch up on sleep

**Sunday (July 21)-** Receive a text from the president stating the following

*""I have some unfortunate news. I'm afraid I'm going to have to let you go. You are a nice guy but I don't feel like you took initiative on the trip. I've given it deep thought and have made my mind up. If you'd like to talk, I'm available for 20 minutes before my flight.""*

&#x200B;

What a dick, right?!

&#x200B;

I can assure all of you that I was on my best behavior during this trip. The only thing I can think of in terms of not ""showing initiative"" was that I wasn't very outspoken due to the fact that I was traveling with a bunch of strangers going to an alien trade show ON MY FIRST WEEK. I didn't want to say too much because I would have made the company look silly for hiring a young guy who knows nothing about his surroundings. They gave me the option to start on the 15th or today (July 22nd) and I chose the earlier date to try and show initiative, but it looks like that totally backfired. 

&#x200B;

Now here's the really awful part. I had three other very promising leads after months of job searching. I told all of them that I had found a new position a week ago...and now I'm going to look like either an unreliable employee or a total fool when I go crawling back asking them for another chance. I know that this is only a minor speed bump in life, but this has all but broken me. I've been trying to figure out what to say to my other options and I'm at a loss for words. This ""new"" job totally screwed me and now I'm left to pick up the pieces.",1563834281.0,2019-07-22 18:24:41

634,My boss wants to fire me for ‘vibes I give off’ and I’m in a very uncomfortable position now. Need some advice,355,9gt8yo,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9gt8yo/my_boss_wants_to_fire_me_for_vibes_i_give_off_and/,100,"So I’ve(23f) been with this coffee shop for about a year. I was with them when they first opened up, and since I was more knowledgeable than them I became shoed into a ‘supervisor’ role. They were thankful for the things I knew and brought. 

It’s your typical mom and pop, run by a mother and daughter who do not get along very well.. that was the first red flag.

In all the business is thriving, but as far as policies, guidelines, and behind the scenes organization they are a MESS. 

I have been closing/supervising full time, which is a hell of a task. Tasks have not been properly divided, punishments have not been handed out, and there is seemingly no specific protocol to follow.  Perhaps because half the staff is family, or friends of family. It is extremely uncomfortable for me, because I have this ‘title’ but I was not given instruction or pay raise... even though I have asked multiple times. It is very ‘make up as we go’. (Reviews were due 6 months ago for example and still haven’t been done.) 

Well about 2 months ago I had the pleasure of slipping and impacting my knee, which has led to issues and filing for workers comp. I was out of work for almost 3 weeks, and getting them to be understanding was impossible.

Upon returning the mother has been VERY passive aggressive with me. She also has taken it upon herself to randomly pop in, or warn me she is watching on the cameras. Okay, I get it, I’m doing my job fine. 

There have been multiple times in the past month where she straight flipped out on me:

Once because I changed the Spotify playlist (not unusual, we do this daily and have no rules). Resulted in asking ‘what’s WRONG with you’ in front of customers. 

Another time I asked her to get us Ice because we were running out, and she told me to do it on my lunch (I’m not doing something for the store on a lunch I have to clock out on) which led to her being very mad at me. 

Another for throwing away a coffee no one had picked up (after 30min and the cup was leaking) and she insisted she was planning on drinking it. This led to me always assuming. 

There have been countless other things, weird comments, feelings of competition, telling me I’m doing something wrong when it has the same result and offers no differing effects. I have remained respectful.

Last night as I was closing, she brought her daughter in and they had an hour long pow wow with me, laying my last paycheck on the table and threatening to end my position there if I didn’t promise to change. 

I was shocked. There reasoning for this? ‘All’ of my coworkers have been expressing concern and fear of working with me. They would not provide me with examples, and I do not believe this as I have great relationships with them. They then said they went around asking, and that I have been blatantly ‘shit talking’ the owners, and telling people not to listen to the way they do things. 

I kept pressing for examples so I could change, and all they could tell me was that I seemed ‘off’ and like I ‘didn’t want to be there’ through ‘vibes’ I gave off. That I was more closed off, and was tainting their family business vibe they want to give off. 

I pushed back on it and apologized while telling them ‘I’m sorry, I haven’t noticed this in myself, but maybe I might come off that way to others, and don’t agree with actually feeling this way, though there are some issues that do concern me.’  I also asked why they waited until now to approach me. 

The mom WENT OFF. She listed 3 dates, on which (specifically) I had ordered food and didn’t ask her if she had wanted anything, but I had asked my coworker. 

She thinks I did that to SPECIFICALLY single her out, and not include her. 2 of those times, we had agreed to order out lunch before she had arrived, the other time I had already noticed she had lunch with her.

This is straight fucking weird to me. She couldn’t even talk about this calmly. She began to fake cry, and told me I’m always out to get her, and I make her feel attacked. That I’m trying to get others to go against her. Because I didn’t ask if she wanted something from Wendy’s on a few occasions (there are other times I have asked, and she has always said no). There was no room to speak or explain,she kept shouting ‘NO YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING YOU ACT SO INNOCENT.’ And insisted there are ‘other’ things. 

Now I should mention, before all this she was suspiciously NICE. She would randomly give me a small bonus (that I would refuse and she would insist), offer extra days off, invite me to family events (I would be busy and decline). She had this air of like TOO much nice, it was inappropriate and looking back it came across as fake to me. 

The conversation felt so much like bullying that I wanted to break down in  tears and walk out. I feel targeted. 

A fellow coworker heard part of this conversation and approached me today to let me know that she HAD NOT been asked anything about me, and only hears positive. She was rather upset with the way they had been talking to me, and told me I shouldn’t stand for it. 

I had no option other than to agree to change, though I’m not sure what that entails... I mean we have kids who have called out 5 days a month since starting and they have had no talking to. We have multiple employees who act out(including one who hotboxed the office and was only given a warning).

Of course I’m looking for another job now, but nothing is looking up.
What should I do in the meantime? Can I salvage this(don’t really care to). How Can I stay sane until I find a new job?


TLDR: my boss has become crazy overnight, I’m assuming because I was on workers comp. it’s getting to the point I feel bullied and am being pushed out. Help? In anyway?

I recently began searching Indeed and for every single job I apply I’m asked to take some weird assessments based on what the position will call for. 

This is the weirdest thing I’ve ever seen added to any job search. Before any actual human contact is made after a cover letter and resume is submitted some third party site is deciding whether or not I pass some useless assessment and then maybe I’ll get a phone call for a job interview? 

Hell I’ve gotten past this “assessment” part for many positions and the next part is a pre recorded questionnaire I answer on the phone?

I’m so confused to all this, it seems like companies are now trying to automate the hiring process and I’m worried if myself and others will ever get past these ridiculous trials to even talk to a human person.

What’s everyone’s thoughts, is Indeed destroying the job search market?

Edit: a lot of people have said that it’s not assessment through Indeed. Just to clear it up, yes there are third party assessments, but, also through Indeed. ALSO note that you cannot retake the assessment, it gets permanently stuck  onto your profile, and you can never see the score. Ummm what?

https://www.indeed.com/assessments/frequently-asked-questions-job-seeker

Edit 2: I have been made aware you can retake and know your score, and make score private for these tests. Please note, the assessment tests I’m taking about are not personality tests, although they are out there. It is a skills test based on basic skills anyone would have within that category which makes the test pointless. In addition most of these job listing require a BS/BA where if you had the degree you would know the answer to these test questions.

Edit 3/Summary: After reading through ALL the comments, I’ve come to the conclusion that there are many people who believe that it’s essential to weed out candidates before an initial human contact is made. For some reason or another it has been pushed into your thought process that this is normal, please know that it is not. 

It is never the normal for a potential employee to make you jump through hoops to even get a basic greeting if they’re interested in you. It is not normal to have a random algorithm and program score card rate your ability to weed out “liars.” 

An employee/employee relationship should always be a mutual understanding and agreement between both parties. You’re not a dancing monkey. 

Anywho, that’s all I have to say on that. Thank you all who made comments and responded and I wish everyone looking for a job the best!!",1556862831.0,2019-05-03 01:53:51

For the longest time, I visualized myself at this job as holding onto the side of a ship, with my knuckles an unnatural shade of white and my entire body dangling above a vast scary ocean. 🌊

I used this metaphor a lot to inspire myself. Thinking, “I will NEVER let myself drop down into the ocean! I’m going hold on as LONG as I can, no matter what!” Even if I saw my coworkers fall into the ocean, I would keep holding on. 

Sometimes there would be thunderstorms and times the ship would violently shudder (coworker got raped on the job, getting bedbugs from a client, union busting, racism, sexism, sexual harassment, etc) and I would tell myself to HOLD ON and DON’T QUIT.

However, now that the company made the decision to fire me, I feel like I am falling into the ocean. Because I spent all this time staring above at my company ship, afraid to fall off, I didn’t even see all of the other boats, ships and islands in the ocean. And because of the experience gained from this job, I know how to swim to get to another ship. Or maybe even make my own little boat. (Eg self employment.)

My arms are tired from trying to hold onto this ship. It was too slippery, and I never got to be ON the boat, sitting and walking around, like other people. 

I am now in the ocean, looking for my next ship. I have a life raft with me, so I know I won’t drown. And I see my former coworkers around me too, finding their own path. Some are happily on top of other boats!

I am one of the best in the team despite being only 3 years here. I know some new hires are getting even +35% more than good employee with 6-7 years experience.

The company is also looking for new hires in my region to help me lower my workload and they are struggling to find valid candidates. I speculate I may find myself training someone getting paid more than me. Until now I didn't act because I was still enstablishing in my role but now things completely changed and I have more bargain power.

When I called my manager to ask for a raise he surprised me by saying he already had a raise planned for me and we're gonna meet next week to close the deal.

I didn't explicity mentioned sums and he didn't either on the phone. I just basically told him I would not want to leave but I know my worth. But from what he told me I am 99% sure it will just be a minimal pay raise (so only +10/12%) like my company policy usually apply for raises.

1. How do I prepare for the meeting, in case the raise is only +10% ? My manager probably does not expect me to demand more.
2. Should I just get what they offer me and look for other jobs?
3. I hate the possibility I might be forced to leave just to get a competitive salary for my role. How do I let my manager know I won't take an offer under a certain sum without appearing too confrontational?

\*\*\*EDIT ONE\*\*\* Thank you very much for your insights, I'll update this thread once I discuss the matter with my manager and see where it leads.

This week is the director’s birthday.  My co worker who is in charge of getting the gift card, just told me that they usually give more money when it’s the directors birthday since she has “expensive” taste. I was completely shocked and taken aback because she literally asked me for more money than what I had already given her. I was completely embarrassed. I was appalled that she would ask me for more. I give what I can give each time. 

Am I over reacting? I really don’t want to give more, but I feel pressured to do so. I also don’t feel like giving any more to the gift cards. I thought it was quite rude to ask for more. People give what they can.",1544661577.0,2018-12-12 19:39:37

The coworker was a long-term employee of the company and was involved in my hiring and was more senior to than me in the department.  He assured me that the CEO, who was not in that day, had given him the authority to fire me and he would get me one month of severance if I left quietly and IMMEDIATELY.  If I made a stink, no severance.

It was quite a decision to make on my part.  I had been there for one year and always had a distant relationship with my boss, the CEO, and worked pretty much independently. I had never got any type of formal oral or written warning that I was not performing on the job. 

Also, I was in process of completing a number of important corporate initiatives and had meetings scheduled with about a dozen people.  There were also a number of emails that needed to be responded to.  People, I liked who had no connection to my situation, were depending on me.

I asked if I could wait until the CEO returned on Monday to discuss it with him.  That idea was rejected and my coworker said again the CEO does not fire people himself, he delegates the job.  And the Coworker was given the job to fire me.  I told him about all the scheduled meetings I had and the emails that needed to be returned and countless other outstanding issues.  He said he would take care of it.  But how?  (He would not sit down with me to go over all the issues I was facing- reports, emails, scheduled projects, meetings, etc.)

I continued to push back and he said, if I did not leave immediately he would call security and he would fight my unemployment claim and not pay any severance.  There was no HR Department and I asked a couple senior managers and they knew nothing about it.

What would you do in this situation?

ADDED TWO HOURS LATER:

From the OP again:

Now I have got some replies and had time to think about the situation some more, I will tell you what happened:

I went up and down the hall looking for senior managers who may know what is going on and everyone I talked to expressed ignorance. I looked for the executive assistant of the CEO and found out she was gone for another week. So there was no one to verify this with.

I started to think of my relationship with the CEO and the job itself and decided that the company and situation were so dysfunctional that it was not worth it. I went to the co-worker's office and told him I was going to leave and clean out my desk.

Two weeks later I got my final paycheck and the month in severance pay. I applied for unemployment insurance and got it without a problem. They contacted the company to find out why I had left the company and no one replied.

I still think about this situation now and then and wonder if I could have held out or got the decision overturned by showing up on the next Monday. But maybe it not be would be worth the stress.

Six months later I got a new job and one year later my wife and I saw the man and his wife who fired me sitting at the next table at a restaurant. I went over to be polite and say hello. He would not look up and refused to acknowledge me.

Thanks in advance!  


**Edit**: I did it! I've been WFH for about a month now, and it happened much quicker than I thought it would. I'd been WFH partially for about a year previously, but I'm now able to do it full-time. This is what I did:

1. Put together a complete presentation with research (companies that have given their employees freedom to WFH full-time and seen strong financial and productivity boosts). I also gave a specific account of my previous year of partially WFH and how I benefited from it. 
2. After the presentation, I simply told my boss that I'm not happy in my current state and that if I'm not able to WFH full-time, I would potentially be looking elsewhere in the near future. It helps that my boss is amazingly cool and wants this kind of transparency in the work culture. Probably wouldn't work for everyone.
3. This all went to the higher ups, which informed me that I could WFH with a few conditions. After negotiating what those conditions would look like, I'm now free as a bird!!! Thanks again for everyone who helped answer this question for me.",1533601367.0,2018-08-06 20:22:47

I was let go at the director level in a large corporate company. I quickly had several Director level interviews quickly. I could always get to the final step but never got the offer. Here are a few of things I learned over the last 7 months;

1. My personality and charm got me to the final interviews, but I lacked some the skills those jobs were needing. You have to prepare for the skills they are going to ask you on. I always prepared but not enough to get the jobs. Example- Senior Project Manager that needed experience in a specific system. I did have experience with that system, but when I got to the interview I had to take a timed quiz in that system. Of course it did not go well.  

2. Cater your resume for every single job you apply for. Write a new personal cover letter for each job. Research the company and apply your background to their job.  The quick applies are great on LinkedIn, but rarely result in a phone call. If you see who posted the job, type up a personal note about your interest to them. 

3. Reach out to all your contacts and ask for help. I cannot stress this one enough. This is the tip that got me 75 percent of my interviews and the three offers. I posted on LinkedIn, Facebook, and made phone calls. You will be surprised how many people want to help that you have never even talked to. 

4. Never burn any bridges when things don't work out. When I got the rejection email or phone call, I would always send a nice personal note. You never know when someone will cross your path again. I became good friends with a few people with a company where I ended up not getting the job. I have now accepted a job where that relationship will play a key part in being successful. That 3 months of interviewing was not in vain. 

These are just a few things I wrote down this week after thinking about this process. I know it's easy to get discouraged, and I did several times, but if you put in the work, you will find a job.  Good luck to everyone and let me know if I can help!",1572730812.0,2019-11-02 17:40:12

650,Friendly reminder: you don't owe your employer anything you're not compensated for.,347,6e0smr,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6e0smr/friendly_reminder_you_dont_owe_your_employer/,15,"It's probably the most commonly posted question here:

""My boss has unreasonable expectations of me and I haven't seen a raise in X years. How do I ask for a raise?""

There are a lot of ways you can solve the short term problem of getting the raise you deserve. However, the true answer to the underlying problem is 9 times out of 10: ""look for another job"".

It's quite simple: an employer that needs to be strong-armed into compensating you fairly for the work that you do will **always** need to be strong-armed into it. 

Not only that, but the longer you work for them, the larger the cumulative amount of money you will have left on the table. Not only that, the longer you stay there, the weaker your ability to negotiate your next salary will be.

This applies to all types of employment. Whether it's hourly/contract/salary/at will, doesn't matter. If there is someone out there willing to pay you a fair wage when your current employer isn't, it's completely within your right to go find that employer and then leave.

I'll take it a step further: your goal in life should always be to find the employer who is most willing to **overpay** for your services. Much like employers can take advantage of a workforce that may be desperate for a job, it should be our goal as the workforce to exploit an employer that is desperate for an employee.

This micro behavior of not fighting for what you're worth is what companies/employers depend on to make the most money possible for themselves. It's not like by getting paid less that leftover money is going to needy children in low income areas - that money is going straight to the pocket of someone who already makes way more money than you.

Don't let that happen. Put pressure on your employer. Always.",1496099673.0,2017-05-29 19:14:33

652,What no one tells you when you choose your degree,350,b0l5c5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b0l5c5/what_no_one_tells_you_when_you_choose_your_degree/,174,"So the standard advice when you choose a degree is that you should find something you can be good at, which you like, and which also is in demand. This actually applies to quite a lot of fields. But there's one thing no one tells you, which you don't learn until it's too late:

You should choose a field filled with people like you. It will make the job hunting process a whole lot easier once you graduate.

&#x200B;

I chose to study Psychology and specialized in I/O Psychology. I very quickly fell in love with the field, I attained excellent grades, and the demand within the field is very high and still growing. Unfortunately, one thing became apparent when I started getting close to graduation: Although I got a lot of interviews, I got nowhere with any of them. In contrast, my classmates who had worse grades and worse resumes in general (in terms of internships, extracurricular etc) would get job offers after a few interviews for similar or even the same positions. I tried everything I could to improve my interview performance - I went to training workshops, I asked friends and family for mock interviews, and I read up on every imaginable preparation method. I tried asking for feedback on my interviews, but it was all nonsensical - typically related to something that was neither asked about in the interview nor specified in the job posting - and I got the feeling that most interviewers weren't comfortable telling me why I wasn't getting an offer. No matter where I tried to look for feedback on what I was doing wrong, I ended up with nothing. Six months after graduating I finally landed a job (even though I had started applying a year before graduating) in recruitment. It was the last thing I wanted to do, but it was something.

&#x200B;

After a while I realized that our clients would reject perfectly qualified candidates for no apparent reason. When I Inquired on why they had rejected those candidates, they'd all tell me that they didn't feel like the candidate would fit in. My colleagues informed me that this was pretty normal, and told me to find some random point on the candidate resume to provide feedback on. I instead opted for honesty, which a lot of candidates expressed enormous appreciation for. Not once did I experience a candidate getting angry with me (as my colleagues had warned me about). However, being an I/O psychologist I also had the necessary skills and vocabulary to explain this to candidates.

&#x200B;

Anyways, I realized that this had to be the reason for my lack of previous success as well - it fit perfectly. Suddenly I realized that I was very different as a person than most people in my field. For instance, I was very concerned with the quantitative and analytical aspect of psychology, and how it could be systematically applied. However, a lot of my classmates absolutely hated this part of the field, instead studying psychology because they wanted to work as much as possible ""with people"". I would also describe most people I know in the field as more mild mannered and consensus (as opposed to competitively) oriented than myself. This has resulted in a pretty frustrating aspect of my career: Interviewing for jobs is a nightmare, and by far the most difficult professional task I face. For my previous classmates it seems to be quite the opposite: They ace the interviews, but are stressed out when they start their roles.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR: Before you choose your degree, try to meet someone working in that field and see if you have chemistry/common values with them. This will make the job hunting process a lot easier.**

I sent out about 100 applications, got two interviews (one which I botched), and now I just accepted a great job offer! So don't get discouraged. It will happen, it just might take time and a whole lot more effort than it should.

Everyone has their own way that works for them but I decided to take a lot of time and think of/look up a bunch of behavioral interview questions to prep myself for interviews. You don't want to spend months and months trying to get an interview only to screw it up (like I did the first time). For the job I ended up getting I had 3 interviews (one phone, one skype, and one in person) and these questions really helped me. And when the interviewer asks you a question that you have prepared an answer for, don't jump down their throat with your answer. Look contemplative and answer thoughtfully... even if it is a bullshit question with an even more bullshit answer. And for the most part about 5 situations/examples can apply to almost all of the questions.

For all of these questions, make the answer relate to the job as best as possible and answer in the STAR format. S&T = situation/task (what was the situation/task). A = the action you took. R = the great result that happened because of the action you took. Interviewers looks for these things.

1.	Tell us about yourself. [They ALWAYS ask this one so make sure you have a good/concise answer]. 
2.	What are you passionate about?
3.	A time where you had to juggle many different commitments?
4.	When have you had to work with a team? 
5.	Give an example of when you were working with a team and things went wrong.
6.	Tell us about your ability to work independently.
7.     What are your strengths?
8.	What are your weaknesses? [Never say something stupid like ""I work too hard"". What I used was ""I am not bilingual"" or ""While I am good at computer programs like MS Excel and PowerPoint, I am not good at any actual computer programming like Java, HTML, or C++]. 
9.	An example of how you managed conflict.
10. 	Describe a difficult situation at the workplace and how you handled it?
11.	An example of when you managed change.
12. 	What are your goals in the future (make job specific).
13.	Describe a time when you took a leadership role.
14.	What are 3 things a manager could do to help you?
15.	Describe a situation in which the usual approach was not going to work.
16.	Describe a complex problem that you fixed with a single solution.
17.	Tell me about a time when you made a difficult decision and how you knew it was the right solution?
18.	Tell me when you made a bad decision and you were able to learn from it and make a good decision later?
19.	An example of when you realized your idea wasn’t the best and you went with another one.
20.	Describe an error of judgment you made in the last couple years, what was its impact? 
21.	Tell me about a long-term goal that you achieved or that you are still working towards.
22. 	A time when you had an obstacle in achieving your goal. What was it/how did you handle it?
23.	A time when you had to do something on a tight deadline. What sacrifices did you make? 
24.	A time you needed the cooperation of your peers who were resistant to what you were trying to do.
25.	A time when you disagreed with a manager?
26.	A time when you wanted to achieve a great outcome and weren’t satisfied when others said it was good enough?
27.   A goal you had which you wished you had done better. How could you have improved?
28.	A time you took a big risk and it worked. What was the outcome?
29.	A time when you took a big risk and it failed. What did you learn?
30.	A time you took on extra responsibility.
31.	A time when you had to deal with a critical piece of feedback.
32.   Have you ever over-committed yourself/couldn’t follow through?

Specific Client Service Questions:

1. An example of when you used customer feedback to improve. What happened?

2. What was your most difficult customer interaction/how did you work through it? 

3. A time you went above and beyond?

4.	When is it ok to say no to a customers request?

5.	An example of when you were able to anticipate a customer’s needs?

6.	A time when you had to balance the needs of a customer to the needs of a business. 

7.	A time you had to respond to an unhappy/frustrated/impatient customer?

I know there are a bunch more than this but I hope these questions help you guys! Nobody likes getting stumped by an annoying interview question only to have to bullshit an answer on the spot. Best of luck!

I would like to think as myself as personable but I'm starting to doubt that. 

I graduated from a state school with a B.S. in Criminal Justice (thanks for scholarships and whatnot) with a 3.5GPA. I was a member of the honor society, but wasn’t able to get any internships my senior year. Since I commented over 2 hours a day to school 3 times a week, I didn’t really care for extracurricular like other frats or clubs. I barely made friends since all I wanted to do was go to class and get everything over with so I could go home and do my day job so I can afford to live. 

Here’s another problem, my last actual job was in 2013. I worked retail for 6 months, then had a 6-month contract stint at a biotech firm doing data entry thanks to my dad. When I moved to go to college, I moved furniture on my own through Craigslist, helped stage houses, and do yard work all under the table. I didn’t pay taxes on that money earned, which is why I don’t include it in my resume. Which has kinda sucked since I’ve been applying to state and federal jobs and I don’t want to risk putting it on there.

Since I’m fat, I also don’t want to join the police department. I’ve also applied to probably 100 or so insurance adjustor entry level positions or entry level bank fraud positions and the **only** call back from those I’ve gotten is an interview to cold-call sell life insurance through some sketch insurance company I’ve never heard of. 
_____

It’s honestly depressing, and I don’t know how much more I can take of this. To be rejected over 300 times for this bullshit make me want to go into the woods and not come out. 

I’m in Virginia, and 200 or so of the job applications have been in the VA / DC / research triangle, area. 100 or so have been as far south as Georgia, and as far north as Pennsylvania. I’ve been trying to stay on the East Coast because that’s where my family is, and I can commute to the job interview, but that hasn’t happened yet. However, at this point, I’d move to Colorado or Utah if I could get a job. I have no debts, and would consider moving ANYWHERE at this point. 

I’ve used USAJobs, state job boards, Governmentjobs.com, Indeed, Snagajob, and nothing has helped. I’m honestly ready to throw in the towel. 


I would classify myself as intermediate with Office Suite, I know how to do a lot with Excel and Word, except Pivot tables and VBA scripts, I’m still trying to learn that. I know how to use Adobe’s Suite, and have considerable knowledge with PS, AE, Premiere, and Illustrator, but I doubt I will ever use Adobe’s Suite in a workplace setting.

Rant: Yesterday was the tipping point, where I had applied to a low level government intelligence job over the summer and had a phone interview. It went great, the interviewer and I vibed (as much as I hate that word), and I was selected for the next round. I waited a month for their HR division to email me and yesterday I got an email asking for my transcripts so they could move forward. An hour later I get a recall notice for the email from HR. I thought nothing of it and sent my transcript and asked if there was anything else they needed from me. This morning HR got back to me with “The email was sent in error. Unfortunately you were not selected for a position with XXXXX. I apologize for the inconvenience.” That was literally a dream job and to get selected for the 2nd round then apparently not just pissed me off. 


I honestly don't know what to do now, and I think I just wrote all of this to get it all off my chest because my parents and friends don't know that I'm struggling this fucking hard to get a job. All my friends have careers at this point, and I'm still moving furniture and doing odd jobs to make ends meet, and I still don't declare anything on taxes since I live in a room in my uncle's condo that he rents out. If I were to declare my income I wouldn't be able to pay rent, and eat rice and beans. It's a good thing I graduated without any debt. ",1538673151.0,2018-10-04 13:12:31

659,I finally got an offer after 5+ months! Some things I've learned plus musings.,351,f0irap,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f0irap/i_finally_got_an_offer_after_5_months_some_things/,46,"After over 5 months of unemployment, I was offered a position today.

My interview was this morning, and the call came 2 hours after I left. The offered salary was at the lower end of their listed range for the position, so I countered and the HR rep said she would ask how high they'd be willing to go. I told her that I was excited about the company and the position but that even the high end of the range was below my previous salary, and that I have an interview on Tuesday so I would wait until then to respond. She said she'd send the counter offer by EOD today.

Y'all, I'm so excited and I want this job. It's also significantly the shortest commute I will have had in more than 5 years. Quality of life is important, so I'm taking that heavily into consideration with regard to pay.

This whole time I've been job hunting, I used an ATS tool to tailor my resume for each job ([Jobscan.com](https://Jobscan.com), which is free through my unemployment office and offers 5 free scans per month). I also used [JobHero.com](https://JobHero.com) to research potential achievement statements, based on real resumes submitted to their system. And I wrote thoughtful cover letters. I started out super nervous at interviews and after a few unsuccessful ones I got more comfortable. My unemployment benefits run out in about 3 weeks, so I was starting to get truly anxious.

About two weeks ago, I decided to try something different, so I took a bunch of assessments on Indeed and started applying to any reasonable job with an ""Instant apply"" option. I used to get a response for a phone screen or an in-person interview about once a month (once every 20-60 submissions), and since I changed my strategy I got 4 invitations in about a week and a half. I've probably applied to 20-30 jobs using Instant Apply. I went on 3 interviews this week (and there's one next week that I mentioned earlier)

Basically, what I've learned is that one strategy may not work the best for everyone. Once I started getting good results from Instant Apply, I decided to do that some of the time while dedicating myself to tailoring resumes and writing cover letters the rest of the time. This new technique might have worked for me because I've been working for 13 years and already have lots of keywords in my resume just by the nature of my career trajectory. Who knows. Maybe nobody is using Indeed assessments. I also linked some writing samples as ""publications"" on the site.

At today's interview I also shared a copy of my most recent performance review, which was super positive. (Not sure if its weird to do that, but it felt like it could help.)

This post is mostly a brag, but I also wanted to share some tips and also share how unemployment and job hunting are HARD. It's so easy to lose confidence and feel desperate. I've racked up a small credit card debt and gone full weirdo hermit mode and back again.

If anyone has tips on negotiating in my situation, criticisms of my techniques, or tips for others to get out of long-term joblessness, please feel free to share. And thanks for being an awesome resource during these dark months.

Today I got an email from an old coworker asking for help with something. She has taken over my project, while I was laid off.

Her question is simple enough, but I'm worried it's going to open a door to her constantly asking me questions. Then I'll be doing work for free. Her question also seems like she put no critical thought before coming to me.

I mostly feel like the company laid me off, they can deal with whatever consequences of that without me. If they feel like they need me, they can give me my job back.

Thoughts?

Edit: it was an email from someone at work to my personal email. And this person 100% knows I was laid off. Thanks for all the feedback.

At this point, I'm considering just saying ""I don't remember without looking at the project."" And if they ask me to do that, then I'll ask a consulting fee.

I feel pretty comfortable with her so I asked “Why does this only affect me?  Does this mean all of the new-hires are already making this salary?” And she sheepishly said yes.

I wanted to follow up and let you know I had a meeting with my boss and the owner this morning : 

Before I could say anything , He wanted to talk about my numbers .. I was saying about how I can't meet them bc they are too high    , I’m standing in as the receptionist doing two positions ,  but since I can't meet their sales goals they ""refuse "" to pay me more bc they are being ""more than generous with their wage "" (13$/hr) and if money is something that I'm going to be upset about then I shouldn't come back, bc he doesn't negotiate . Oh and guess what ... I'm a not a permanent employee anywhere up to 6 months( which makes me eligible for commission and health benefits)  !!!! Until they decide I’ve pulled in enough interviews/candidates. Saying he doesn't give benefits and permanent jobs to ""just anyone "" everyone I see in the office right now has gone over and above and take the weekend phone without asking for over time pay  (for example ) and asking for more money already doesn't impress him!!! Can you believe it ? I’ve never updated reddit on a post but outcome of this was too ridiculous!!! Lol !! Happy Monday everyone!  

If you know a company that hires on the spot or does a video interview I would appreciate that 😂😂😂

Cheers everyone!


TLDR: is the title of this post.
To be fair , my first warning sign from this company was when they lied to me about my job and what I would be doing . I was supposed to be hired for front desk coordinator  which I found out pays 17$ an hour when Im actually doing telemarketing / cold calling (for a staffing agency) at 13/hr. I was told I was going to get commission as well , that is not the case anymore . 
The excuse I was given was at my next review ,they would go over my numbers with me , and go from there . So , probably not getting that . 

The front desk girl quit abruptly (wonder why lol) and they expect me to do all front desk functions .. everywhere from answering the phones.. job orders .. checking ids for paychecks , to helping people endorse a check (you can’t believe some of the people we get in the office) which makes it *impossible* to hit my numbers , which get higher everyday . I’m expected to make 200 calls and conduct 30-40 20 minute interviews per day right now , but as you know with sales they want you to do a lot more than your quota . At least thats what the owner told me in passing yesterday . “If we say 40 interviews , we mean at least 50.” WTF LOL . 

I’ve taken about 3 days off last month and two so far this month to interview other places . I expected to be confronted about it but it’s always like we are glad you feel better get back to those phones .  So the opportunity doesn’t present itself to talk and I’m nervous to be let go not on my terms , because I can’t afford to lose a job without another one lined up . 

Today I am actually not well at all , when I called off my boss said , every time I’m not there , im keeping my co workers from making money . If I’m not sitting here at the desk that makes it so “one of us” has to do it and can’t get job orders filled . Funny , bc I wasn’t hired for that . Also funny how my calls are the “initial contact “ and they count on me to get people in the door and money in their pockets that way . 

I feel uncomfortable here . And I know I need to get out . I just have to find a way to play the field and not be under so much pressure with little pay until I get the hell out .

What should I say to them? How should I say it ? I don’t want to come across insubordinate .",1568408524.0,2019-09-13 17:02:04

My husband works for a small company of about 20+ people.  Upon the first check of this year, his employer also gave the employees their W-2s along with goodies like company logo booklets and pens.  One employee blurted out ""well thanks for these goodies but wouldn't it have been better to give us more on the Christmas bonuses?"".  My husband states that his employer then refused to look at him at that point.  He then inquired with his coworkers and found out they all received a $500 Christmas bonus except him - they didn't mention it because they assumed he received it as well.  So a few minutes later...his employer comes to him with his check and tells him that he and his wife (also in HR for this company) thought my husband didn't need a Christmas bonus because we were doing *well enough to take a Christmas vacation*.  Does that make sense at all?

First of all, his company doesn't always work weekends (if they do it's only on Saturday).  Christmas fell on a Tuesday this year and we were only out from Saturday through Wednesday the 26th.  Secondly, he told his employer well over a month in advance of our plans.  Third, none of the other employees worked Christmas Eve or Christmas either! 

He called off an extra day afterwards as I fell sick with the flu....but how does this warrant an assumption that we are ""well off""? Even if they did work the Saturday before Christmas, I feel like my husband properly requested the time off.  

His boss told him he will ""check with his wife"" now to see if they have enough money to give him a bonus.  I'm at a loss on what to say because this all seems so shady and unfair.  What should he tell his boss?


Edit: Thank you guys for the advice! He was approached by his employer today and given a bonus (yay!) along with some excuse on why it didn't come the past 2 checks.

I graduated with my undergrad but didn't know what to do after, so I continued on with my masters. I also started a part time job to help pay for school. 

 After 2 years in grad school, I graduated in 2016 and now I had to go job hunting. I still lived with my parents, and didn't have any work experience in the field I got my degree in. I was depressed because I felt like I didn't deserve my degree. Thought I just made it through school out of sheer luck. Basically I was suffering from imposter syndrome. I felt like I let my parents down.

My parents immigrated to the US for a better life and my dad had no money when he came to the US.  He got laid off after a year and had to move our family around to different states. He had big mental breakdown and suffered depression from the job anxiety and just the cultural shock he was facing here. He was unemployed for months and at one point we were almost homeless.

 It was tough for us but he finally settled in a company. I learned from my family that hard work and determination can get you anywhere. If they did it and realized their American dream, I can do it too.

So back to my story..
I had been job searching for a while.  I was still at my part time job and I enjoyed working there but I wanted to  do something more, challenge myself and work in my field.  I felt like my degree limited me in some ways. People judged me and thought I was overqualified education-wise, even though I had almost no relative work experience. I just wanted a job where I could help others. I wanted a fulfilling position. 

I cried, and felt depressed some days. I would lay in my bed, feel hopeless and compared myself to some of my friends who had gone to ivy league schools and had six figure jobs. Here I was and I felt like a  failure. My parents came to this country for me and I failed them.

One day after talking with a friend who was going through the same thing, I just decided I need to take initiative and if I didn't have work experience I should try to build that in some other way. I started volunteering so that i could be more productive, and do something fulfilling. And that helped me so much with my public speaking. I joined professional groups in my field to network and build my skill sets.  I added all this to my resume. I started getting more interviews. Some were promising but no one called me back. It was tough...

I applied to my dream job and thought I would definitely get it, but unfortunately did not. This broke me down. In some mysterious way, the day I was notified I didn't get my dream job, a recruiter from another comapany called me to set up for an interview the very next day. I was excited because this was a full time position and at a company I really valued. Plus they offered benefits, unlike my dream job. But there was always that voice in my head telling me that I would never get it once they met me and that I didn't deserve it.


Well I am happy to say I got an offer and accepted last week. It has been a tough journey but I can't believe I found a job, especially in  a field I am passionate about! I am very excited, but nervous because this is my first real full time job.  

I just wanted to share my story because this forum really has helped me with my job searching and I wanted to say thank you to the posters here. And if anyone is in the same boat and feels discouraged, please don't give up! Sometimes the universe works in weird ways and opportunities will fall in place. Sometimes it takes hundreds of applications to get an interview or an offer.  Don't give up! Be persistent. It's okay to cry, feel anxious, stressed or depressed. You're human and it's going to be tough. I just wanted to share my story. I'm sorry for the super long post. 

Edit: i just want to clarify that i know sometimes it wont work out because life is never fair and its not going to be easy. But dont let that deter you. I'm not implying  a full time job is everyones end goal, since everyone has different goals and things they find fulfilling in life. I justed wanted share that my life experiences especially with my family have taught me that I should keep pushing myself and to never give up. Whatever goals you have in life, big or small, keep going after them. Do what makes you happy. Success is defined by what you find fulfilling in life and not what other people think of you. I learned that from my parents. I stopped looking and comparing my life with others. What is it that YOU want to do and accomplish in life? Go for it and dont stop pursuing it.",1525411085.0,2018-05-04 01:18:05

675,This is my story (from 0 coding experience to getting into a 60k offer as a java developer),343,1o5ntf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1o5ntf/this_is_my_story_from_0_coding_experience_to/,88,"A little background about me. I spent a long time in school because I wasn't a good student, wasn't smart, and spent more time on video games than anything. Finally, I graduated last year in December with a terrible degree that has nothing to do with computers and with a 2.0 GPA. Yeah I fooled around too much, and never took school seriously.


So then I saw how my highschool friends were doing so well in the big 4 tech companies (google, apple, etc) as software dev. One of them graduated with a 3.2 gpa in EE and he is now getting paid 200k as iOS developer for Google. After seeing that I realized how good programming is and how well they are getting paid. Then I did some more research and found out that there are people getting paid in 6 figures without computer related degree as well. That immediately became my goal and my motivation.


Around January this year, I started teaching myself how to code with mostly internet source (codecademy and w3schools for example). Anyway so from January to mid March, I learnt the basics of HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery. I just learnt the basics, didn't build any projects with them, and slapped them as skill sets on my resume. 


Around late March, I got a job in my area as a technical support which paid 14$/hr. Of course, I did some research and knew that tech support won't be paid as high as software developers and I shouldn't spend my time here forever. From there and on, I just did the bare minimal work and spent rest of the time learning java on the internet (1 of the site I used mostly was thenewboston.com) After I learned the most basics and played around with it. I started going on youtube and followed a ""let's build a game with java"" video tutorial. That sparked my interest because I used to play games all the time, so might as well just make my own. I spent about 4-5 months finishing the video and understood what each class does for the game and replaced most of the game components with something else (like background, sprite, music, menu setup, etc). After that I just put that on my resume and made a hyperlink to it, so the recruiters can download the files and look at my ""version"" of the game if they want.


As soon as I finished those and updated my resume, I immediately started getting calls for interviews for programming jobs. Of course, at first I failed some technical interviews, but it was okay, because I got the experience and knew what I need to work on. 


About 3 weeks ago, I had about 4 job offers (ofc, passed their interviews) and now I am about to leave my current company today and start a whole new career as software developer. Oh yeah, did I mention? I have a non IT related degree (it's like general study) with a 2.0 gpa.


Now instead of me who was thinking about spending another 3-4 years getting a BS in CS, why not have someone else pay me and have them teach me with some actual software work experience. :)

note: time it took from 0 coding experience to a programming job is about 10 months, and the new job is in Virginia

tl;dr, get motivated, learn some skill sets and anything is possible.

So, I plucked up the courage and told her I was leaving the country to go back to my family, because my family needs me right now. When I told her she started crying and demanding to know why I was leaving and that she was hurt that I would't tell her, because she tells me everything in her life. I told her I don't want to discuss it and that it is private, but she now keeps bringing it up all the time.

I now have to work one more month with her (which is going to be very tough), and each time we have a call about work she will interrupt me and say ""tell me the reason why you are going back? Is someone dying?  You still can work for me from back there. I can't understand why you won't tell me."" Then she will message me after work saying ""What am I going to do without you? Tell me why you are going back."" Each time she talks about it on the phone it makes me really uncomfortable and I don't know what to say, and I ignore her written messages when she asks.

I don't know what to really say to her, as I have now asked her over ten times to not ask me, but she is still doing it.  I am tempted to say to her, ""if you ask me one more time then our work relationship ends now, as I have respectfully asked you to not ask me over ten times, and you are not respecting my wishes"", but she is pretty crazy so I am scared she will try and sue me if I leave before the end of my notice (we are in Germany btw).

I don't do it in an impolite way. I wait til the end of the interview to assure they won't bring it up, and once they ask 'Do you have any questions?' I inquire as to the possible pay rate for this position, if I am considered for it.

I don't push if I get the usual 'It's based on experience.' (which always irks me, you just talked to me, you know my experience, you should know my payrate) and I just let it slide. I only ask once.

However, as hard as it is to make a living nowadays, how are we expected NOT to ask for the rate of pay? Especially if we are already being considered for another position (which I am, which is why I ask, because if the position pays less, I'm gone) or have a job offer.

I’ve been desperately looking around here and there for something that needs rearranging or some box I can move somewhere, and there’s just nothing.

687,"I was bombing all my interviews, until I came up with my new method. It's been a huge help.",344,2gsbet,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2gsbet/i_was_bombing_all_my_interviews_until_i_came_up/,26,"I wrote [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2eqzcz/ive_applied_to_100_jobs_in_the_past_few_months/) about writing cover letters and other application tips that got a lot of attention, so I thought I'd follow up with everyone about how my interviews went, and what worked, what didn't.

I bombed my first few interviews because of a combination of things: I am a bit of a nervous interviewer, so I got tongue-tied at one interview; because I wasn't 100% clear on what one of the jobs really entailed; or because once I found out more about the position I wasn't as enthusiastic and it showed.

I went back to the drawing board and realized that I think much more clearly through writing than speaking, so I decided the best way to go about my future interviews would be to write out my answers to all potential interview questions. Then I read them out loud to myself, and then followed up by ""answering"" the questions without looking at what I wrote and from memory combined with a healthy amount of improv. It involved talking to myself at loud volumes locked in my room like a crazy person, but I went into each interview as a much more articulate candidate than before.

Basically, I created a doc with every question I could think of possibly needing to answer, and wrote out a few sentences, just to get my thoughts on paper. By the end, my doc was about 13 pages long, so I really went through dozens of questions. Here are some examples of the questions I wrote out:

1. **About the company/role**

* What do you know about this company? *For this question, I wrote out the company's mission statement in my own words, as well as a sentence or two in my own words about the department/team I'd work on.*

* Why this company/role? *I wrote out why I liked the company, focusing on their mission, but more info on why I liked the role, focusing on my skill set and how it applies, while showing that I understand the role. I also focused heavily on how my current role has a lot of transferable skills to this new one, with examples.*

2. **Questions about myself**

* I made sure to answer questions about my strengths, weaknesses, a monologue for the ""Tell us about yourself"" questions, and an answer about what role I play when working on a team and whether I prefer teamwork or individual work. I also had a monologue prepared for ""Tell us about your current position,"" ""Where do you want to be in 5 years,"" and ""Where else are you applying."" I tried to make the answers as genuine as possible--I think it's important to realize that the person asking you is human and doesn't want BS robot answers.

* I also made sure to have about 3 stories from my current and past jobs that could answer questions like ""Tell us about a time when you failed and learned from your mistakes,"" ""Tell us about a time you had to work with a difficult team,"" ""Tell us about how you deal with negative feedback,"" and similar questions like that. You can usually use the same 3-4 stories to fit any of those questions.

3. **Questions for them**

* I tried that have 10+ questions ready for when they say ""Do you have any questions for us?"" You'll only need to ask 3-5, but it's likely many of the questions you had prepared will be answered. This was the hardest part for me, but it's so important.

* There are some questions that you can use in every case: ""What is the day-to-day like in this role?"", ""What is the growth trajectory?/Where could I be in 1-3 years?"", and (at the end) ""What are the next steps?"". The rest of your questions should be tailored to the role and company. They know form questions, but this is your opportunity to show you are creative and understand the role. For example, for a research-based role I recently had, I said something like ""When I do research currently, these are the resources I use. What other resources would I have access to in this company?""

* Also, I tried to ask questions I was genuinely curious about. This is an opportunity to learn things like, what is the culture like? What are the best and worst parts of the position?

The biggest problem with this method is making sure you don't sound too rehearsed when the time comes. That's why I found it helpful to write outlines of answers rather than full answers to each question. I hope this is helpful to everyone! PS--if anyone is curious, I am in final (4th or 5th) rounds of interviews for two companies, so this method has been super helpful to me.",1411094971.0,2014-09-18 22:49:31

The owner on the other hand, didn't exactly take it well, but it went better than I expected. I sent him my letter of resignation at 8 in the morning before I left for work. I kept it professional, said my peace and he immediately emailed me back saying he was depressed, how the company is on the upswing, and if we can talk about it.

I told him it wasn't about the company, or him or anyone at the company, but about my career and growing it, and I'd really appreciate it if he could support me in this, as I've dedicated my time to his company for 8 years. He then said me leaving would crush the company, and I interrupted him and told him that was not fair to me at all. 

He backed off a bit after that and said I'm his best employee and that he really wanted me there by his side while the company grows. He then offered me a 10k raise and a 5k bonus.

Approx 3 months ago my boss got written up with her failure to do her job properly. She was put on a plan to correct those actions (I did not know this at the time)

About a week after this happened I had a closed door meeting with my boss, not cause anything crazy was going on but we where going over some contracts my region had in place, and ideas to grow the region even more. During this meeting my boss suggested I do something unethical. I told her ""No thats wrong, and you know it"" she responded with ""I'm your boss"" i responded with ""Doesn't matter its wrong"" she told me to listen to her I said whatever and the meeting went on with me knowing full well I would not listen to her.

3 days later HR calls me, tells me I need to sit down with them and discuss some allegations. 

Long story short my boss claims I inappropriately touched myself. that I was rubbing my balls and suggested we have sex on her desk and so forth.

My boss is middle-age over weight and not my type. I defended myself and HR said we'll be doing some more work on this. I said fine.

Later that day we had a sales meeting. Now when we conduct sales meeting the protocol is whoever wants to speak grabs the gavel and they get to say what they wanna say.

I get my turn on the gavel, I stand up and tell everyone about my very interesting meeting with HR. I ask all the other 8 sales reps what they think the chances are that I fondled my balls and suggested that I have sex with my manager on her desk.

There was a death glare from my boss, but her boss (who has been trying to fire her for quite sometime kept her quite)

After I finished, she stormed out of the building.

The next morning I was called into HR again.

I was advised that I shouldn't have done what I did, however they received 5 phone calls and 8 different emails about my character and believe my side of the story and that my job is safe.

Its been a minute, I got a new boss, I've not seen my old boss since then.

My new boss does have a great sense of humor, when I had my first meeting with him I said ""Don't worry I won't fondle my balls for you""

He laughed, life is good.",1470456494.0,2016-08-06 00:08:14

695,Working destroys my mental health,338,al5qj5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/al5qj5/working_destroys_my_mental_health/,177,"Hi all, 

TDLR: 23M I hate working, the idea of working, always have and 5 months in and I hate getting up every morning, day after day for something I couldn’t care less about. Work makes me depressed and I feel I am wishing away my time on this earth. I can’t help but feel envious of those job hunting or unemployed as at least they have time to do what they please whilst I’m stuck spending my weeks and days in an office not wanting to be there. 

Post:

For years I've known that I would hate the ideology of working full time and I wasn't wrong. 

I'm a recent graduate and have been in full time employment for just over 4 months now since graduating. I'm in a pretty decent job at this point of my career as a graduate and in terms of salary and hours being pretty advantageous over the generic graduate jobs in the Uk. In addition, I know for a fact I could be worse off, and by no means am I ungrateful, as I am doing better than most of my friends who are also graduates in similar stages of life to me (to be blunt). 


I've found it difficult to accept that I will be having to work more or less until the day I die in this day and age. For years I've known that I wouldn't enjoy the concept of ""work"" now I'm here I feel there is no where to go and this is it for the rest of my life. The idea of having to get out of bed in the morning for something you don't give a monkeys about, and spend all day doing, day after day, week after week, month after month and year after year until it's all over scares the shit out of me. To be honest, I hate it, I hate getting out of bed in the morning for this, I hate spending all my time doing it, but I have to and everybody has to. 


In before the ""snowflake"" comments too, I cant help but feel the state of economic and political progression has influenced this feeling towards the working life stye. With the 400% rise of property prices in the Uk over the last 50 years vs the minimal % rise in salary, the idea of working forever is incredibly demotivating, especially since that  I/my generation will have to work for significantly longer in order to acquire the basic necessities as an adult including a home and being able to function normally as a human being such as living with shelter, washing, eating etc - compared to the older generation who didn't have this degree of challenge. A common motive I hear is that without work, you can't afford anything, which is true and I've definitely been on both ends of the spectrum from having less than £20 in my bank account and to having a salary - and yet I still feel that ""getting paid"" still does not weigh up to the constant struggles of working. 

Not sure where I'm going with this, but I hate working and consistently think what is the point of it everything in life, if life is purely based on working a job that you never really care about, purely for the financial advantage that would allow you to meet basic human functions and to live. 

How did you accept that this is the way life is supposed to be / is accepted to be and how did you accept working full time for the rest of your life time? 

How do you cope with the norm of this way of life during your professional career? 

How are you supposed to be happy - when the majority of your time on this planet is spent doing something you probably don't want to do at a place you probably don't want to be at? 

TDLR: I hate working, the idea of working, always have and 5 months in and I hate getting up every morning, day after day for something I couldn’t care less about. Work makes me depressed and I feel I am wishing away my time on this earth. 23M

EDIT: A few comments saying that I have never been unemployed: If you’d of read my post I mentioned that I have been broke before with nothing in my bank account. Since November last year it took me over 1000 job applications to get me a job where I am now in this very competitive graduate market. I graduated in June and started working in September. That’s 3 almost 4 months having fuck all and being unemployed, so yes I have been unemployed and been completely rock bottom for money and I do know what it’s like. In addition, I have been working jobs since I was 16 and I have had to work for all of my stuff since school. So this “entitled lazy” persona does not apply to me. ",1548830323.0,2019-01-30 01:38:43

I have been looking for a job since I graduated the end of March last year. Have sent in hundreds of applications, getting feedback on my resume, updating and doing certifications and a few personal projects to boost my current skills/keep them sharp. I graduated with a B.S. degree in Statistics and have a few projects under my belt from past courses and personal one that i display on my github (also on resume).

I have had a few interviews and a few final rounds but I would always choke/get nervous, especially when there was a test/technical component to it, or lose to someone who was more experienced when I was only trying to get my first job. 

I feel worthless when everyone would tell my that I have a good degree and that I would have no trouble with getting a job. Well its been more than a year and nothing. I made the mistake of not willing to relocate which limited my job search (Top 3 populated city in the U.S., fierce competition for entry level) and honestly am at a loss. Im 25 now and feel like a loser. Got ghosted by 2 companies when March hit, (one even ask me for my schedule for a zoom interview with hiring manger and the department VP, they never replied). I thought maybe it was definitely time to seek something else for now, but the pandemic hit and I find myself overqualified for even retail jobs because of my degree.

The recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn with a position and no company, and I found the company name by searching her job description and matching it to a listing. It turned out to be a company using really cool technology that matched my background and interests. She said that the knowledge I had made the interview easier for her and that I sounded like a nice person to work with.

I realized that the main difference between my good and bad to average interviews was how genuinely excited I was about the company. I have a hard time faking interest in a company with an unexciting product or core values that don't match mine. I think it's worthwhile to frame your company research around finding something about them that piques your interest and that would make you excited to work there. 

When the company's work is meaningful to me, I:

\- ease my anxiety about trying to land the job

\- have the peace of mind that I am being honest and not trying to be anyone else

\- present myself as personable and friendly instead of robotic

\- am eager to share about myself as much as I am eager to ask questions

I was excited about the role, the pay increase, and the growth opportunities. 

Now, at the end of November, I’m not so sure. Training for my role was nonexistent, deliverables were ambiguous, and timelines are a joke.   The majority of my work is virtual, and the larger department I’m part of is split between the UK and US, with my immediate team all UK based, including my manager.  My manager started with the company in September, so she is also new.    When it comes to getting questions answered, I put time on people's calendars, which usually takes 2-3  business days, minimum, but occasionally I can get quick questions answered through instant chats.  I also do go into my local US office regularly to get a sense of camaraderie, and can find out info this way too.  

Still, almost anything I’ve learned about the work and getting things done, I had to figure out on my own - which I am proud of.  BUT... it means I discovered some things late, resulting in ""fire drills"" of effort to get stuff sorted out, impacting others, and of course, got chewed out over.  My job responsibilities have majorly shifted, and I have yet to receive meaningful feedback on anything I’ve produced, despite a few requests.   I also don't really have measurable goals or performance objectives, which I find odd, since everyone is always discussing how important these are to the company.  By this I mean, my manager can explain how my role contributes overall to the company, and what I'm falling behind on immediately - but there's no sense of the mid-term.  The system to track all of this just got a major overhaul and has some glitches.

So, here I am, 5 months in, spending 8-12 hours/week frustrated about roadblocks (unclear processes, cumbersome systems, finding/chasing the right contacts, technology bugs, and of course, time zone differences). I thought I was hired to contribute expertise in my discipline, where I have a graduate degree, but it’s rare that I’m asked to make recommendations or given the opportunity to do so.  When I’ve voiced these concerns I’m told variations of *This is the way this company, and every large company, operates.  Influence what you can, and build resilience to what you can’t change.*

I’m flabbergasted the company could provide so little support and direction. This is the first job I’ve ever had where I have left the office literally crying in frustration.  

How can I tell if this is unique to this company, or if it really is every large/multinational company?  And how can I build my resilience to roadblocks I can’t influence?",1543713212.0,2018-12-01 20:13:32

That being said, I don’t work in the right field at the moment for that job.  I work in retail.  Retail management to be more exact.  

So in order to find that perfect job, I am going to have to change the field that I work in.  

I know that means that I will have to take an entry level position, and work my way into that perfect job.  

Since when do entry level positions require 2-5 years of experience?!  

Its impossible to get an entry level job without that kind of experience, but you can’t get that kind of experience without first being hired into an entry level job!

This is crazy.  I have never had such a difficult time finding a job.  I have a solid 10 year job history (only 3 employers in 10 years!), no gaps in employment, excellent references, and have ended up in management at every job I’ve had. 

I don’t think my expectations are out of reach.  I’m not delusional, so I expect that changing fields means I will probably get paid less than what I make now, and I’m not looking at jobs that require degrees, or that I’m not qualified for.  Yet, I have been searching for a new job for almost 6 months!

I have had interviews, which generally lead to either never hearing anything back, or being told that the company has chosen a more qualified candidate.

- She told me my desk was too clean, and said not to “waste time” on it. This is ridiculous. I don’t spent more than 10 minutes a day cleaning

- I organize my stuff into small, labeled bins. She said it was a waste of time and it was better to be messy. 

- She’ll ask me to do something that’s not urgent. I’ll leave to go to the bathroom, and when I come back she mentions that “5 minutes have gone by. Do you not know what to do?” Then she’ll report to my manager I can’t do simple tasks when I’ve just been away for a small bathroom break

- I wear a mono-colored, long sleeved Hanes t-shirt and long pants to work every day. I wear flat shoes. None of my clothing is tight. My hair is always up in a ponytail, and I never wear makeup. She made a remark about how I dressed like a whore, and mentioned I was vain for wearing contacts.

- When I used a soldering iron, I asked her where the temperature setting was. She told me soldering irons don’t have temperature settings (blatantly untrue, she never went to school for electrical engineering, else she would know some of them do), and reported that I lied about knowing how to solder and that I refused to acknowlege when I needed help.

- Every time she talks to me, she stops by my bosses desk and gives him a scathing report. 

-She can see my status when I’m logged in to my computer. She never fails to message me the minute I get into work. If I don’t have a clear “daily plan”, she mentions to the boss I don’t know how to break down my work into small tasks

- One of my friends from school works at the same company, and is quite brilliant. She asked if I got my high GPA by getting him to do all my homework for me. I have never once in all my years of knowing him asked this friend for help with any of my homework, and turned down all his offers to help.

715,Just because you didn't get the job doesn't automatically mean you aren't worthy or are a failure,328,7zi8sf,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/7zi8sf/just_because_you_didnt_get_the_job_doesnt/,44,"So I have been job hunting since September. I have had a LOT of interviews. But yet, I still don't have a new job. 

I could have had a new job, I even had one lined up, but the problem was they lied about the job and they never really offered the job to me, during my second interview they just assumed that I was going to take it, and it was very weird, desperate and aggressive. Long story short, I had to go back on the job offer. 

But lately, it's got me thinking. I was starting to think that I was a failure. I've been searching since September, and haven't been able to land any jobs. 

Sometimes, I was applying for jobs within my current employer, where the jobs were already spoken for-I never even really had a chance. Is that my fault? Does that make me a failure? No! They already knew who they wanted to hire, before they even saw my application; the interview for an internal candidate is just procedure. 

But what about the other jobs I've applied to? Even though I did end up getting the rejection e-mail or phone call, as much as it still sucks to not get an offer, I wasn't really saddened by it, because as I sat in some of these interviews, sometimes I would think, ""ehhh that's sketchy"" or ""they didn't mention that in the job description..."" or they would ask weird questions that didn't really seem to be related to the job (what's your horoscope sign? can you come in and work for free for a trial run to see if you flow with us? We know the listing says our starting pay is this much, but how much were you looking to get paid? Our budget is tight). 

So you need to remember, interviews, are for you to get to know the company and the job better, too. Just because you end up getting rejected, I'm sure there's a chance that there's some of them that the feeling was actually kind of mutual that you wouldn't be a great fit, and they wouldn't be a great fit for you. 

I think it's hard to overlook this because if you go to so many job interviews it seems like many failures, but it's really not. 

I'm sick of this job search process and it is still frustrating and disheartening, but I think that it's really just more frustrating that *I* haven't found the right job, not so much of not being accepted by a company and getting a job offer. I'm trying to take my own advice here, and will try to continue to do so as I continue on my search and wait back to hear from two more interviews. ",1519361568.0,2018-02-22 23:52:48

""We have some history"" was what they said, so they definitely remembered me. They didn't use the ""expert"" line, but they had some pointers for my resume, which I will actually take into consideration because they were really constructive.

They also said I have an ""excellent resume"", and while the market looks really rough for work these days, I think they will actually do their best to place me. Really glad with how this turned out.

Thanks to everyone for your advice. I was nervous as hell, but I did some prep, had a few answers in my back pocket, and it was definitely one of my better interviews in recent memory.

\------------------------------------------------

So I met with a recruiter 6 years ago when I was having a lot of trouble looking for work. I was nervous as hell but I tried my best to prep, came in with copies of my resume and work samples, bought presentation material, etc.

Basically, the recruiter said that unless I'm ""an expert"" at a particular skill, it shouldn't be on my resume, and that I must be lying on my resume. It was literally the worst interview experience of my life.

Turns out I have a zoom interview for a job next week with this same person. I just lost my job and this opportunity would be a good one, but I have less than zero interest in talking to this person again.

I'm all for constructive criticism, I'd love some on my resume in fact, but what this person did was just demeaning.

I get nervous on interviews as it is, and I'm legitimately not sure how I'm going to do this. Is there a professional way to handle this? Should I just suck it up and do it? Xanex (seriously)?

***Edit:*** *Whoa, this blew up way more than I thought it would.*

*It's pretty clear I have probably have a good amount of emotion invested in this experience that this person may not even remember. I need to do some prep work for sure, but how it goes from there I think will be determined by their professionalism.*

*It's a job I would like, but wouldn't make my career or anything, so it's not worth taking abuse for, but it's been a while since I've been on an interview, so best to at least get this under my belt and do the best I can with it.*

717,Interviews: things I've learned from the other side of the table,328,e6rxo0,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e6rxo0/interviews_things_ive_learned_from_the_other_side/,159,"Hello! I'd like to preface this novel by stating that I have not been the sole decision-maker for any candidate. These are simply a few things I've gathered from my experiences as a panelist for various retail and corporate roles. AND, I'm not implying that anyone on this sub would land in The Bad or The Ugly categories. So, these ""chapters"" just serve as rants.

***The Good.*** *Yay! Do these things. =D*

\-*Try not to sweat if there are gaps on your resume.* Life happens: employees leave jobs for health reasons, to care for family, to return to school, etc. As long as interim events are briefly outlined, many interviewers will be understanding.

\-A*sking questions.* ""What questions do you have for us?"" Additional inquiries demonstrate not only your interest in the role, but also critical listening skills when you seek further clarification on what has been discussed. A few standbys: ""What are the expectations after 30/60/90 days?"" ""What steps are involved in the training \[substitute with HIRING if you're feeling bold\] process?""

&#x200B;

***The Bad.***

*-Failing to bring copies of your resume, cover letter, references, and/or a notepad.* These documents are not always requested during the meeting and interviewers may already have a copy of your CV. However, you will appear more prepared and confident if you bring these materials.

&#x200B;

***The Ugly.*** *The items below were unanimously frowned upon by fellow interviewers, pushing potentials into the ""thank u, next"" pile.*

\-*Speaking poorly of your current or past roles.* Star candidates can quickly go from ""yay"" to ""nay"" when they begin bad-mouthing others (i.e.""my boss is a terrible micromanager!"") An interview is not a personal therapy session.

*-Arriving late and offering NO explanation.* Again, life happens! Sometimes people are late. Please call your company contact when you realize there is something that will prevent you from being on time. It is frustrating for panelists to wait on candidates and immediately dampers the mood.

*-Wearing jeans!* Not professional.

*-Jumbled, poorly formatted, multi-page resumes.* You want readers to glean your qualifications within a few seconds. Otherwise, the document may be tossed to the side. I do not see the purpose of lengthy objectives or summaries unless you are trying to switch industries (a.k.a. skip this to save space!) Somewhat unrelated, but PLEASE quantify items. Ex: ""Processed a high volume of widgets daily at a fast pace."" Okay, but how many? Even your best, most educated guess will help your resume stand out. ""Processed 300 widgets daily at an average rate of 30 seconds per unit"" is more appealing.",1575627249.0,2019-12-06 05:14:09

I graduated in August with a master's degree in electrical engineering. I technically started sending applications out in May, but I wasn't seriously looking until June. I live in the midwest, but I was mostly looking at jobs on the east coast. I just accepted a job offer in Maryland.

I think I submitted over a 100 applications through company websites or services like LinkedIn and Indeed. I got a total of 4 first interviews, and 2 of those first interviews turned into second interviews both of which were onsite.

The first thing I learned was to use career services and have them look over my resume. I was making a lot of mistakes in how it was being written and the formatting. She was able to make it look much more professional.

The second thing I learned was to contact recruiters through LinkedIn. I got each of my first interviews by reaching out to a recruiter on LinkedIn. Contacting the recruiter is probably the most important thing you can do.  Towards the end of my job search, I stopped caring much about my perfecting a cover letter and worked at finding the right person on LinkedIn to message.

I started the job application process back in January and it's coming to an end now six months later with 4 job offers in the $90k - $120k range. When I started job searching I thought that the most I could ever make was $65k and would settle for $45k. After all of this I wanted to share everything I learned for people who also are driven enough to push their boundaries to get a perfect job. I want to break this post into 3 parts for anyone to skip to whatever is of interest. The first part is what I was doing initially that wasn't working, second part is how my methods changed, third part is what I learned. 

**Part 1**
My initial job search: 

Initially I was following all of the classic advice. Spend a lot of time crafting special cover letters and custom resume tweaks for each position, to go the extra mile print it all out on card stock to deliver in person, call the hiring manger a week or two later to follow up on interest. How did all of this turn out? Some companies don't accept in person applications any more, so no point to print it out on nice paper. Almost all companies have automated tracking systems (ATS, more on this later) so my customized cover letters and resumes that didn't have the right keyword combinations were never seen by anyone and directly discarded. The times that I tried to call the hiring manager were met with hostility or confusion, operators refused to connect me under any circumstance, if I did get through I was told that this was a privacy violation and they would only contact me if I was of interest to them. Obviously this wasn't the case for every one of them, but in most cases the best outcome was often being ghosted or the occasional no-reply email rejection. There were a few lucky times that I was actually granted a job interview, but it was a joke and they would always say that the position was at the bottom of whatever salary range I gave. It was around this time that I realized that they don't care about me, or any other candidates, and I shouldn't spend my time catering to them/the company. If you think about how some of these positions are getting 800+ applications it makes sense why it works this way. Classic knowledge is that if you have the requirements then you can get the job. That's just not true any more. What I thought was me being considerate and thoughtful for the interviewer/company really just made me a weak candidate. When the job hunt wasn't making similar considerations for me I realized it was time to change the process.  


**Part 2**
How I became more ruthless and efficient: 

These days job applications are a numbers game and needs to be treated like one, this prompted me to set a goal to send out 1,000 job applications a month. No excuses, no holding back, and no compromising. Besides the huge amount of applications to send out I needed to increase my probabilities for getting an interview and job. Being able to send out a mass amount of applications and having a higher quality of applications are two different skills so lets break them down separately. 

How do you send out 1,000 job applications a month? 
Firstly I am very lucky that I have a small amount of freelancing work that I can just barely survive on in good months, so I could take the time to treat the job application process like a true 9-5 itself. If you can send out an application out ever 5 mins to 10 mins that is average 50 applications a day that turns out to 1,000 a month. The first thing to do is to set up your own autofill on your browser. Most browsers allow you to make custom autofills to fill in fields, so I spent a lot of time upfront filling out all of my personal information and resume information into an autofill option. This quickly turns 10 minutes of filling out basic information into 1 quick click. Now a single job application that took 15 mins now can take 5 mins. Next thing to help you is which platform that you use. I was often using LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, Zip-recruiter, Dice, and StepStone, these platforms allow you to make your own user profile and quickly submit job applications for whatever companies accept application through the website and in the worst case just redirect you to the company website. If you get redirect to a companies website then the autofill would take care of anything. If the posting allowed application submissions from the platform the application was as simple as a few clicks. For every one of these platforms I had a set of keywords that I would submit, to give you an idea of how broad these were my top keywords were, ""math"", ""data"", ""analysis"", ""science"", ""physics"". These general search terms allowed me to see a wide breadth of industries and truly apply for everything in every sector. 
I chose which positions to apply for based on only two things; firstly could I have any tiny amount of interest in this position, and secondly do I have at least have half of the basic qualifications? If I could at least say yes to both of these I applied for the position. With all the job profiles and autofills and completed job profiles the application itself could be anywhere from 15 seconds to 5 minutes from beginning to end. 

How do you make each of these applications quality? 
The most important part of this is always keeping in mind that most of the time people will not see your application if it is not selected by the application tracking system (ATS) first. To get around this I spent a few weeks seeing how to use this to my advantage, to see if I could fool these systems to getting my resume flagged with high importance/ matching instead of throwing them out. Most of these systems are just rudimentary keyword searches, so I completely rewrote my resume to be a hotbed of keywords. After my first rewrite I had so many keywords that it didn't even make sense when humans read it anymore. These were keywords that I found through collecting 100 job postings I liked and running them through keyword search engines that I found online. They keywords that came up the most I put every variation of them in my resume. Do you want to get work writing computer codes? Make sure your resume has all the keywords for that: programmer, programming, debugger, developed, develop, code, coder. No joke, some of these old ATS systems might be only matching for the word programmer but not programming. After I worked out all the keywords and made it somewhat readable for a human it was set. The last thing that you must ensure is that ATSs can parse your resume correctly. I realized that my first resume could not be parsed by older systems and so my whole document came out as a single word and got no responses because systems never could recognize anything. Spend just a little time on testing free online ATS systems to ensure that your document is being read in correctly. This is not a problem for .doc/.txt/.rtf files, but more so for .pdf files. 
This is a good start but you can get it better, you can sometimes get the recruiters to give you free advice. I did this by creating an email filter. If I get a new email with the word ""unfortunately"" or ""impressive"" I have it set up to send a follow up reply email. The follow up email says something like ""Thank you so much for taking the time to let me know! This was a position that I was really excited about and felt that my skills and passions matched perfectly. Would you have any feedback on my application? Thanks for blah blah blah...""  Honestly I completely forget about all of the positions that I have applied for and hiring managers almost never replied to this message, but the ones that did really provided a lot of insights, about how to present myself or my skills, or keywords to get better chances of being accepted to an interview. Use this information to rewrite your resume. While there is a lot of emphasis on resume keywords also make sure that you have content on it. Your actual resume is supposed to show what you're capable of, so I found it acceptable to stretch the truth within reason. If I know that people are looking for something specific that I am confident that I can pick up quickly, I stretch my past experience until it would satisfy this experience requirement. Obviously don't go too far with this or blatantly lie, but keep in mind it's proactive to think that you're showcasing your potential capabilities not just things that you did a few years ago. If you're not too sure you can do that then consider adding some resume fillers. A resume filler is something that isn't too significant but creates a more comprehensive image of you as a candidate. Get a bunch of online certifications, if you have partial knowledge of another language then list it, if you can add any links to your old work then add links. If you have work to showcase but its not online yet then put it online. Make a tumblr/wordpress/blogspot to post it, then go pick up a free domain (I think .tk domains are still free). Then suddenly you have a huge display of your work at MyPortfolio.tk, if you don't have a skill or project and you're trying to gain a new skill, try posting your progress on your website instead. If you're more invested in making a nice website go to squarespace and buy a domain on godaddy. 

KEEP IN MIND: a good resume is only the thing that gets you the chance to get an interview. That's were the work begins. 
What is an interview? At some level it is that if you say the right things you can get a job. Obviously there is more to it than this, but if you approach it with that premise you can improve. Before an interview spend an hour reviewing the company and the recruiter or hiring manager that you're talking to. Obviously you should review the job posting and have general basic knowledge of it, but if they are calling you for an interview they believe that you're good. The company history might be in depths if its a huge company, if it is a small company you could impress someone at that scale too. Look up the recruiter or hiring manager, any information that you could find you can use to see if you can connect with them. Some people have terrible cyber hygiene and googling their name brings up their instagram, linkedin, pintrest, and other info. Use this to learn about what they like, how to connect, and what they look for in new hires. Applying for everything also gives you a bunch of interview skills, if you send out 1000 applications a month you'll eventually get a bunch of interviews rolling in. Use these to practice. They all ask the same questions with small variations plus the occasional unprepareable question, you can get used to these and know your answers with them and can tailor the answers to the position and the hiring manager if you do your research. Plan to have the first 10 interviews for just practice. Spend time initially reading basic interview questions and preparing some basic bullet answers, but after 10 - 20 position interviews you'll feel more natural, especially if you get to second, third, fourth, fifth interviews. Expect to throw away the first 5 -8 interviews, just free practice in the school of life. How can you shape your answers to gain the interest of the interviewer/company/positions? If the interviewer grants you the chance to interview then they believe that you can fulfill the basic job requirements. REMEMBER their job is to put the best person in each role to do better, they are trying to reduce the RISK of hiring someone who can't fulfill the role, quit, or otherwise pose an issue. In your interview your job isn't to show that you fulfill the basic requirements, your job is to show how you are the best choice among all the other candidates. If you know anything about the other candidates then use it to your advantage, if not you can ask the interviewer about where you stand, and if all else fails then read up about people who already have this position and use the same language and ideas that they use. You can go on glassdoor and indeed to see what employees are saying about the company. I recently was applying for a position and a handful of the employees on glassdoor were saying that they like how conscientious the company is, when the interviewer ask me why I wanted to work for this specific company I led her through my normal sculpted answers and at the center of it I landed it with how conscientious this company is and I couldn't see myself anywhere else. Landed it, I ""completely understood the company and its culture"". Even if you don't have access to employees feedback, read articles and watch videos of the job/industry and learn their language and terms. Keep in mind the first interviews are to see if you basically fit the position/company. Later interviews are to harder gauge your proficiency of this positions, you have to do your homework here, it's not all bs answers. You have to have a bite if you're going to bark, and you want to bite much harder than you bark. If you get to the third to fifth interview really put in the time like you're in school studying for an exam. Some of the soft skills still go pretty far at this point, but only make the difference if you win the harder parts. I normally add everyone on a that I spoke to on linkedin after the third interview, I review my interview notes to add a personalized message to each person specifically. There's pretty mixed feedback on this, but people often react positively and no one has ever called me out, ymmv. 



**Part 3**
What I learned after all of this: 

At this point after everything that I've written reflects my experience and opinions that can best be summarized that the job hunt is ruthless, to win it you have to be ruthless back and put in the hard work. After all of this I got 4 job offers strangely around the same time. If you get an offer see how long they will hold it for and see if you have any potential job offers in the meantime. If you pushed hard in the interview and you are selected they probably really want you. Use this to your advantage and see if you can get two companies to compete for you. I was a little lucky in getting 4 at once, I used the highest offer to put pressure on the other 3. Then I came back to the highest one and said look the money is great but I have three offer that aren't too far off but with better work life balance/ benefits/ hours/ or anything vaguely correct and they rebutted with a much better benefit package and a competitive promotion track. Some companies are really out there to pay people as little as possible, see if you can avoid them. Think of how much money you think that you can make, then think about a dream amount that would make your life better. In the salary requirements section only put that dream amount. People who want to pay you as little as possible will always see how little they can get away with. Companies that value their employees will not be incentivized to hire you for a smaller amount of money if they want you, moving your salary requirements down only harms you.

All this isn't to say that these are gimmicks that I used to my benefit. There was hard work all along the way to learn how things work and how I could use everything to help instead of compete with, from the application process to resumes to interviews to salary negations. Initially I put a lot of time up front to learn and study everything and set up my resume and interview skills, but then it was just about letting the process run. This subreddit is full of great and unique advice, youtube in absolutely full of help for everything in this process, and there are so many great books that are available online to help. Use all of this to your advantage, learn how each step works, study your faults, see how you can make yourself a better candidate than everyone else, and submit as many applications as you can

In closing I recognize that this is what worked for me and will only work for a few others, you have to be in a very fortunate position to make this work for you. Most people just don't have the time to send out this many applications or bounce between so many interviews or others may not wake up motivated to send out at least 50 applications a day for months. Some may not be so lucky to have experience they can stretch or other face great difficulties in transitioning. In any case, 6 months of hard work studying this process jumpstarted my career. At the start of the process I was so eager to chase a $45k position and just a few months later I'm confidently rejecting $95k positions in favor of better offers. Hopefully everyone finds a little bit of useful knowledge in this post! People who are dreaming of changing jobs please keep in mind that you can still use this process, but instead of 1,000 applications per month do 1,000 per year. That's about 20 applications a week, which is only about 1 - 3 hours of work on the weekend. That's about 100 hours of work a year that could pay off significantly. 

Good luck and perseverance to everyone! 


**tl;dr**
Job hunt is a numbers game so submit as much as possible, optimize your resume for applications tracking systems, take as many interviews as you get for the practice, win early interviews with soft skills win later interviews with knowledge and study a lot for both of these, think of how much you expect to make and increase that range a bit before you put in your desired salary range, see if you can push on employers to give you a better starting offer.


Also here is a poem that best summarized my feelings towards this whole process in the end.

“I bargained with Life for a penny,
And Life would pay no more,
However I begged at evening
When I counted my scanty store;

For Life is just an employer,
He gives you what you ask,
But once you have set the wages,
Why, you must bear the task.

I worked for a menial's hire,
Only to learn, dismayed,
That any wage I had asked of Life,
Life would have gladly paid.”

I can think of to positions where this happened. 

&#x200B;

Company 1 put me through four interviews with several people over the course of a month. Conducted a background check, checked my references, and conducted a final interview after all that. I was told I did very well after that final interview, and also from the responses I received from thank you emails. I was never so sure I was going to get an offer. Then I get an email saying that they are actually looking for someone with more experience. After all that. 

&#x200B;

Company 2 put me through a six hour interview process with multiple people and a lunch. The feedback was very positive from all. One of the VP's emailed me saying I had a very good interview and I should hear from them soon. Bam, rejection phone call after I followed up. I was then told to email the lady calling me for feedback, and she never responded when I did. 

Company 3 put me through two phone interviews, and a 5 hour interview process with multiple people. My HR contact strung me along for a month, even emailing me out of the blue saying they were still interviewing and they will contact me soon. Rejection.

Yes the customers and the “Karens” I serve annoy me and makes me hate my job but also the workers I’m surrounded with is also one of the reasons I absolutely hate it. This is my very first part time job. I started working when I was 15 and I’m 19 now. Honestly I don’t know how I survived those years working here but I did. 

But anyways, I absolutely hated this job. Managers kept on changing our rosters without notifying us and then blames us and gives us shit for when we don’t show up because of this reason.  Our manager is terrible, whenever someone calls in sick (when they really are sick) they insist that they work, they really don’t care. And whenever we text them we can’t work because of other business they’d come back with a “sassy” comment and say “that’s not good enough. Do better.” 

They berate the juniors and put them down for not being good enough and how they should work harder like the full time workers do. And to top the cake the managers always talk shit about coworkers as if they have nothing else to do. Rather than staff meetings it’s just talking smack about everyone and insulting and calling everyone names.

Before I started a shift I always had this “ugh I hate this job, I don’t want to work anymore, I want to quit.” Feeling and I was not looking forward to put up with everyone. 

But not long ago I got fired (along with some other people) because apparently “I could not keep up with them” but the words  “you’re fired” were pure bliss to me, I don’t have to put up with these people’s shit anymore thank god! 

It’s a really toxic work environment that’s honestly affecting me both mentally and physically. Honestly I feel soooo relieved, I feel so free, I feel so happy I can finally breathe properly. I can’t wait to find a new job that’s better than that hell hole I used to work at! But at the same time I’m absolutely grateful for this workplace to give me some experience at a workplace. So yeah. 

TL;DR: I got fired at a really toxic work place where they treat their workers (especially juniors) like utter crap. I feel really happy and free knowing that I don’t have to worry about working a shift with them.",1605221794.0,2020-11-12 17:56:34
733,Job searching: what works and what I've learned,323,esrwqh,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/esrwqh/job_searching_what_works_and_what_ive_learned/,65,"Hi everyone,

I've been offered a job after a 4 month search! I've been lurking in the shadows of this sub long enough and thought I should do my bit and share what worked for me.

Bit of background, I was applying for HR jobs only and at entry level. 

1. You need to keep applying for jobs BUT bare in mind that this generally brings the least success. I started off telling myself I should apply to 8 a day but that's unrealistic, I was applying for 3 a day since start of January and changing my CV so that it reflected the job spec as closely as possible (in some cases you may need to stretch the truth a little bit but DON'T lie).

2. I know cover letters suck. They eat all your time up and you need to make new ones for each role. But they are necessary if you want to be considered. I made a document with paragraphs for each experience/skill I had. If the job spec emphasised HR admin or recruitment for instance, I'd just copy and paste the pre written paragraphs for my recruitment and HR admin experience. HOWEVER, you'll still have to research the company and include a paragraph tailored to what you like about them.

3. If applying to a job through a recruitment company, find the email of the recruiter and email it directly to them. It will stand out against all those indeed applications.

4. Find a GOOD recruiter to work with. Smaller companies are better than the larger ones in my experience. I went through about 7 or 8 different recruitment companies before I found the one that recommended me for the role I was offered. Lots of them are just about churn and don't really care about the candidates they meet (they just need to meet them to tick a box). The one that takes the time to get to know you, gives you advice before the interview, knows the company well and sends over decent interview tips is the one you want.

5. NETWORK! This is the best way of job searching. Before I found my role, the 4 other jobs which I interviewed for all came about because I knew people who were either leaving their position and recommended me or just happened to be hiring.  You never know who you'll meet or the opportunities that await so book into some networking events, add people you meet on LinkedIn and make it known you are actively searching. Never stop using your contacts, at the very least they might be able to offer some work experience which looks good on your CV.

6. Consider that you might be seen as overqualified. This one may be more specific to me but I realised after my first few interviews that I was coming across as overqualified for the role due to my education and the fact I had previously held a management position. This might scare employers who are hiring at entry level because they worry you'll get bored and leave in a few months. Remember to tailor your CV and list specific things e.g. Shortlisting candidates, arranging interviews and note-taking RATHER THAN recruitment and selection.

7. Do your research for interview and that goes beyond the about us page. Look at some news articles, look at corporate values and try relating previous work you've done to them. Find out who your interviewers are and look at their background. The reason for all this is to enable you to make conversation and answer the 'what do you know about us?' question more naturally or even without them asking it.

8. Try to make the interview a conversation. I know this can be tricky especially if you're nervous, but this can genuinely be the difference between getting the job and being rejected. Employers are becoming more and more concerned about your fit with the culture and team. Smile, laugh and don't be too rigid and formal. Had I not engaged and asked questions to my interviewer, I would not have built the rapport that led to them choosing me over the other candidate who had more experience than I did.

9. Read news, podcasts or magazines for the industry or function you want to work in. If you're serious about building a career then you need to show a genuine interest. You can try to bring these into conversation during interview but it helps to demonstrate that you're serious about building a career. Particularly useful when speaking with senior level interviewers.

10. Job searching is hard and takes it's toll. Set yourself goals and targets, do something active every day so you're not just sitting around. Get a part time job or try setting up a small enterprise to keep the money coming in. I tutored students in maths and English, a friend of mine writes articles for companies via an online agency. 

I was told time and time again by people that I would get a job and it's only a matter of time. But i still felt anxious regardless and couldn't relax or felt guilty when not 'working' or 'searching'. Really though, it helps to take a day off here and there. You won't be able to do that once you have a job so make the most of it.

Hope this helps others to find a role. 

Keep positive and be patient. It will come.",1579808351.0,2020-01-23 14:39:11
734,Should I write a negative Glassdoor review?,325,cynyar,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/cynyar/should_i_write_a_negative_glassdoor_review/,73,"Hi everyone.

735,the one question i found on Reddit that really impressed my interviewers,319,60jmlt,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/60jmlt/the_one_question_i_found_on_reddit_that_really/,87,"i had an interview with one of my dream companies last week, and of course i searched Reddit for interview tips. one thing that many people suggested that i had never heard before, was this: When they ask if you have any questions at the end, always include as your last question, ""do you have any concerns/doubts/hesitations about me as a candidate?"" 

in addition to just being prepared, smiling, dressing confidently, and acting as though these 3 people were already my friends (i had them smiling and laughing before the interview even started), i asked that question at the end. their reactions:

1: ""i LOVE it when people ask this question."" 
2: ""i've never heard anyone ask that before!""
3: *smiles and lets the others do the talking*

they all looked at each other and agreed they didn't have any doubts or concerns. 

1 then asked a question about me personally that wasn't on her list, just out of curiosity, and it turned into a conversation about our passion for the industry and why we chose this specific area. pretty cool. 

i will hear back from them in a week or two, and no matter what happens, it was the first time i felt like i really aced an interview so i'm pretty proud of that--feels like i've ""leveled up.""

Edit: for context, this was for an entry-level admin job (1+ yrs exp) at a large, global company in the music industry. i have relevant experience, and friends who work there, so i knew going in that i had a pretty good chance of things going well.

I did one yesterday that asked me about 20 different questions about possible drug use. 

Can anyone who is actually involved in the implementation /design of these systems actually explain to me why apps are like this? 

Another common complaint is filling out every little detail in boxes when you have to attach resume anyway. I mean why attach it if you have to fill out the boxes to begin with?

I mean, you are not going to be able to tell if someone is crazy or not by asking so many basic questions where everyone is going to automatically select the answers that are best suited for the workplace. So why do they exist?

After 5 months of unemployment after finishing my Masters, 40 networking coffee dates, many carefully crafted cover letters and resumes, follow up emails, etc.....I finally got a mid-level job that pays WELL, with pension AND benefits! A real, grown up job! I'm over the moon! I start this Monday :D 

I applied through the formal process, wrote a VERY specific cover letter that had a scanned copy of my signature, and didn't personally know anyone at the organization. For all the effort I put into stalking people online so I could ask them out for coffee and ""network"" in hopes of some leads, I ended up getting a job through just sending in a normal application.

Finally, when people ask me ""so what are you up to these days"", I don't have to fess up that I'm still unemployed after spending 40k on a Masters degree and then awkwardly change the topic...THIS ALONE MAKES ME SO HAPPY! 

Sorry for all the exclamation marks...I am really happy and excited!!!!


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**EDIT: Wow I didn't know this would get so many upvotes! Ahh! Thanks for all the kind words everyone. Also, just a note, I AM A WOMAN! Why does everyone assume I am a man? This bugs me.** 

Anyways, since Everyone is asking what I studied and how I went about the process, here it is:

**School/Background** I just finished my Masters, which was a policy degree focused on international issues. In terms of past experience, I had no full time work experience. I did an internship at the UN last year, and 3 consulting projects for real clients as part of my coursework. Since the job asked for 1-2 years of work experience (which I don't have), I think the internship and these projects counted for something when they made their decision. I finished classes in April, graduated in June, and was looking for a job for around 5 months and just got my first offer, which I accepted. 

**Networking** This was a key part of the process for me. I paid for LinkedIn premium so that I could send Inmails to people not in my network. I met many people this way, most were receptive and helpful. I'd introduce myself briefly and say I'm interested in the place they are working at, and would like to meet for a 20-30 minute coffee sometime in the next two weeks. Or I would stalk people on the websites of companies and email them asking to meet. Then I would ask THEM to introduce me to other people to go on more coffees with. WHen I applied to a job, I would look up the hiring manager and try to write to their personal email or LinkedIn to introduce myself (I got an interview by doing this). After these networking meetings, I would send a handwritten thank you card to their workplace telling them how I appreciate their time and look forward to keeping in touch. And then of course, I did regular job apps too. I ended up getting this job just randomly, it was a position I applied to off of a job board and they liked my app enough to interview me. 

**Cover Letter/Resumes:** I would always address it to a real human being (used internet to stalk who the hiring manager or HR was). I would also include an address before my letter started (like a normal letter format, but no one does this), and write the title of the person, their department, and the FULL address. Content-wise, I used one or two examples to show how I have the skills they want (and I used exactly what is in the job ad), and tried to include a line about why that job/subject matter in particular drew me to the position. I ended the letter with a signed copy of my signature to show that I went the extra mile. Under the ""Skills/Qualifications"" header in my resume, I would mimick what's in the job posting to show I catered my resume to the job. 

**Interview** went great, I prepared like crazy and read past reports to reference, which showed I was prepared. I smiled a lot, tried not to be nervous, and for everything they asked me I had stories/examples prepared. I went in with a typed out list of questions that I had for them (4-5), which were specific to the job duties (i.e. clarifying something in the job ad), or more big-picture questions about the future plans of the organization. They said at the end of my interview that I had strong presentation skills and had good questions for them. 

**After the interview**, I mailed a handwritten thank you card to each of the two people who interviewed me, even though they both work in the same room. 

A week or so later, they asked for references, and the day after I got this offer! Woo! ",1410956867.0,2014-09-17 08:27:47

or... with friends and family in a busy place... or while driving (don't answer the phone while driving by the way)... or any other situation where I can't concentrate entirely on the phone interview.

Seriously though... Ask me if I have 15 fucking minutes to spare before throwing behavioral interview questions at me. At least ask me if it's an appropriate time to speak!

I wanted to rant a little bit on here because it happened twice this week, making me lose quite a lot of interest in working with these places. To anyone else who experienced this, how did you deal with phone interviews that came completely out of nowhere?

I finally landed a full time job!

Me: M.S in education 4.0, B.S in comm &amp;amp; business 3.8. Six internships to my name. 24 years old.

Basically, I was used to success and not achieving for the past year was really beginning to put me on a bad, bad path.

**Websites I applied to:** Linkedin.com, linkup.com, monster.com, careerbuilder.com, local help wanted site, indeed.com, craigslist.org, snagajob.com, specific company websites I was interested in using a bookmark folder

**Number of applications:** 717

**Number of interviews:** 7

**Ways I got the interviews:** blindly applying online (4), a recruiter finding my resume on careerbuilder (1), networking (2)

**Number of job offers I received**: 2 simultaneously- both were the positions found through networking.

**Things I did**: Looked at meetup.com for networking groups in my area, attended job fairs (waste of time IMO), looked up everyone in linkedin, purchased linkedin premium (worth the free trial to send inmails and express you interest via another route), checked above sites literally multiple times a day, tailored resumes and cover letters *usually* (ironically, 2 of my 7 interviews were from generic cover letters and resumes, go figure).

I love the chrome extension boomerang- it allowed me to write emails and inquiries and then send them the following morning at whatever time I wanted- I always chose 8:28- giving them time to clear their inbox but making me look eager.

**How I eventually got the jobs**: Both of my offers occurred today and they were the only 2 times I ever successfully networked. The worst part in job hunting is hearing NETWORK! I didn't feel like I had a network. Nobody knew anyone. Everyone loved to shout the word network at me, but nobody said how and to whom. When I read the word networking in this subreddit, I would literally facepalm. It just sounds so easy and IT ISN'T! Eventually, I began literally mentioning my job search to anyone that would listen, in any context that was even a little remotely appropriate. At my Aunt's 50th birthday? Anyone who asks me how I'm doing I'd respond with ""good, still looking for a job"" - if they gave *any* opening like ""how is it going?"" and / or ""what are you looking for"" I immediately told them the types of jobs I was seeking. **My biggest piece of advice is when people ask what you're looking for, do not say 'anything.' It doesn't give people a chance to think about who they might know. Try to be vague without sounding vague. For example, I said I'd love a desk position at someplace like a college, or a doctors office, or anywhere with 9-5 hours.** Eventually, I caught my first break at a funeral. I was chatting with a grieving relative of a friend and dropped this line- he put me in touch with someone he knew, and guess what? This is the job I ended up taking. My 2nd opportunity for networking occurred at a college graduation party- a random women overheard me talking and put me in touch with someone. I *literally* told anyone about my search who asked. Hey, they're asking, right?

My second big piece of advice, which I read on this subreddit and constantly had to repeat to myself was **shy people don't get jobs**. In my aforementioned story, I was put in touch with people. Those interactions took me weeks- I called them as much as I thought was appropriate without being overly annoying. I am not shy, but I often feel like I annoy people with my emails and calls. I eventually had to suck it up. You HAVE to call and check on your applications, you HAVE to follow up with more emails- it's the reality. Remember, you're not their priority. They have work and things going on - what is a big deal to you (finding a job at their company) is just another day in their life for them. Be prepared to step outside your comfort zone. I did not check up on all 717 jobs via phone, but only the ones where I felt like I was a particularly good fit.

Once you get the interview, that's a whole 'nother ballgame.

I literally went to bed in tears almost every night. It seemed like everyone had a job but me. I was jealous of people on this subreddit making posts like this- because they had something I didn't. It's so hard to not know when your big break is coming- but you won't be unemployed forever. It's not a reality. One day , you'll find something. I hope all of you sooner rather than later. I wish there was a magic pill or format but that's the worst part- it's unpredictable, no two hiring managers are going to want the same type of letter or resume, and what works for one person may not work for another. This economy sucks, being unemployed sucks, and writing cover letters and resumes for hours on end is the worst. I sincerely wish everyone Good luck, and I hope this helped even one person. 

edit: 6/15/2014- new job at the same company! moving on up. There is hope.

edit 2: 7/9/15- new job at new company. **If anyone out there is having trouble, I am more than happy to look over your resume and make edits. I swear to god, I will help you however I can. I am VERY aware of how lucky I am. Shoot me a PM, I'm very active on reddit.** I believe in you- keep applying! Keep going. good luck, friends. 

Edit 3: 6/23/2016- new job at same company. I am now making triple than when I originally wrote this post. I am now 27. I continue to help people with their resumes. I've made contact with so many people who tell me their similar struggles and I promise you, you're not alone. I will help however I can and even helped get 2 redditors interviews through my (still very limited) connections. I feel very lucky to still be employed. Remember folks, it really does take time. Also remember you're competing against internal candidates, people who have networks, and people who may just know more than you. **new tip** - even if you think you're not qualified, submit the resume anyway (i.e. ""You must have 3 years experience in___' - but you don't - submit anyway) The worst that happens is nothing, and you're already used to that right?

5/15/2018- in case anyone cares, I’m now 29 making quadruple than when I originally posted (which I guess wasn’t hard when it was practically minimum wage). I now have the fortunate ability to be someone who hires people and see a lot of resumes. My offer to help still stands, but a ‘thank you’ is usually nice ;) .

1. My director who I report to is the CEO's daughter and only comes in to the office once a week and is not available via email or won't reply during the week.
2. In a meeting, the director and another senior employer laughed about women mourning a miscarriage and said it wasn't a big deal.
3. My team (about 10 people) openly discussed another team member's sexuality and questioned it without that person being present. 
4. I asked if I could take an early lunch one day so that I could check in on my dog who was staying at the vet following a minor operation and the director asked if my dog ""was always going to be an issue"" 
5. My friend who passed my CV along for this job now makes passive aggressive comments when she sees me outside work or hears about me travelling on weekends. She works 7 days a week and will often visit the office on weekends to do overtime - she wonders why I don't. 
6. Another member of the team pulled me aside last week and said, btw - you always take an hour lunch instead of the allowed 30 minutes and everyone is starting to question where you go... so you should stop that. I was never told lunch was 30 minutes and assumed it was 1 hour as we work 45 hours a week.

For reference: current salary is ~$57k, offer was $40-50k (they’d give 50), and counter was for $55k.

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice and reassurance.  The only reason for countering with a lower salary is because my current does not have any perks above the standard healthcare and 401k (no match).

To me, it just feels like a one sided power-play, or information arbitrage to their advantage. They want to reel inn their best candidates as little as possible, and then when they're 90%-95% committed to the process, they finally get to know their potential salary. 

I can't even count how many times myself, old co-workers, and friends have been called into interviews, and flat out been denied any solid number early on.. It's usually ""We will discus that later"". Then after a couple of rounds you're hit with a dog shit offer, and have to decline because you're better off as you are. 

Yes, yes, glassdoor and similar services work great. But it's the principle that sucks.

It's easier, and more ethical, for a company to decline high compensation requests, than to simply prey on ignorance or desperation. I wish more companies were transparent on this, it would look so, so much better.

755,How to get into a career in IT without going to college or technical school.,314,42lsiz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/42lsiz/how_to_get_into_a_career_in_it_without_going_to/,107,"This got a lot of attention in another thread when i posted it to give someone tips so i thought id make a full thread about it.

A lil about me and my background so you can see where i came from and how this can work for anyone. I dropped out of high school and never went to college. I got my GED and worked in sales for 10 years. I hated it and always wanted to work in IT but didn't have the money or time for a tech school or college. I found out that alot of entry level IT jobs will take you with just certifications and you can just pay about 250 to take the test and that's it. so i did some research and found quite a few tools that are helpful in self studying i wanted to share.


Please understand that there are many ways to take to get into IT and many different types of jobs in IT. This route in particular is to become a network administrator, this is the path that I took. 

**Im not here to argue about the merits of college Vs. certifications, so please do not bother.**


Like i said before I had a background in sales and customer service prior to working in IT. This greatly helped me get into my first help desk position because i already had many skill sets that were pertinent to the position like phone etiquette and **PATIENCE**. If you plan on getting a job in a help desk environment i highly suggest starting with a simple customer service job while you are starting work on your studies.


Also, I showed this to a co worker of mine who went down a similar path and he told me about the WIA grant which is a government grant that pretty much anyone that is unemployed or making less than like 17k a year can qualify for. It gives you 12 thousand dollars in grant money that you can use at places like mycomputercareer.com (i dont recommend using them, that was just an example)
http://www.ehow.com/how_4927098_apply-wia-grant.html


**Comptia A+ certification.**

https://certification.comptia.org/certifications/a 

This certification is focused on basic knowledge on both PC hardware and software. This is your starting point for even those of you that cant do much more than basic use. Even if you dont want to work in IT this is still a great way to learn the ins and outs of a PC just for personal use. It is broken up into two tests. The first is a test on hardware. It tests your general knowledge about pc hardware like what a motherboard is, it may have a picture of a motherboard and have you label what each part is, common TCP ports, etc. The website has a breakdown of all the info they are testing you on.

**www.professormessor.com**

 Start studying here. His videos are 100% free and he is amazing at breaking down the information and making it easy to understand. After each video there are 3 or 4 questions. Answer them and if you fail watch the video again.

**www.examcompass.com**

After you feel you have finished the videos go here to test your knowledge. A general rule of thumb is once you can get a 90 on each section you should be ready for the test.

**www.techexams.net**

The forum on this site has alot of really helpful people and is a great tool while studying.

**www.vue.com**

Once your ready to take the test go to pearson vue's website to find a testing center, schedule your test, and pay for it.

**get a entry level helpdesk job** 

After you have achieved your Comptia A+ certification you should look for entry level helpdesk/tech support work. This is all about building experience for your resume. These jobs typically pay around 15 an hour or so but can pay more depending on where you live and what type of work your doing. My first IT job was a helpdesk position and it started at $42k which is $20 an hour.


Now you need to decide where you want to go in IT. This guide will focus on the network\hardware side of things which is typically working on any of the hardware related issues anywhere from setting up workstations to working on routers and switches.
Some people stick with Comptia from here and get their Comptia N+. This is comptia's networking certificate. To do this follow the same steps as the A+ above just study the N+ info.
Alot of people find the N+ unecessary and go right into Cisco certification. This is what i did, a cisco cert makes the N+ pretty pointless as it is more advanced.

From here on we will be discussing Cisco certs.

**Cisco CCNA**

Cisco certification is alot harder than comptia. The cisco CCNA is said to have a less than 20% pass rate. Its the only cert test i ever failed and had to retake (failing sucks hard because you have to pay those fees again)

The first cisco certification is the Cisco CCNA or CCENT.
When taking the first cisco certification you have two options. you can either take 1 test which covers all the material, or you can take 2 tests which splits the material in half. I highly suggest taking the split test because there is ALOT of information to cover. The split test still gives you a CCENT certificate for completing the first test. Just make sure if you go this route to not stop until you have your CCNA because recruiters will ask you about it if you have a CCENT.

For studying I highly suggest using Jeremy Ciora's CBT nuggets he is an amazing instructor 

https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/cisco-training

It does come at a cost (if your ok with pirating you can bittorent his videos.)

You also need to use a program to simulate routing and switching. I recommend packet tracer as its what i used. You need to become completely familiar with the Cisco IOS using this. Just google packet tracer you should be able to find a free download with little effort.

Once you feel comfortable with your knowledge schedule your test over at vue.com

After achieving your CCNA and having a year or two experience you should start looking for a better job as a network administrator. These typically pay somewhere on average around 60k in the us but vary wildly.

Good luck and if you have any questions hit me up!


**TLDR verision**

See if you qualify for a WIA grant

I have applied to over 100 jobs over the past month and about 1/6 of those turn into interviews. I see the posts on here and I am lucky, because it seems like I am faring better than a lot of people.

But then comes the interviews. The same questions. The lack of follow up after the interview. The weeks that go by. Lack of any communication in general. 3-6 rounds of Zoom interviews with a range of people who don’t seem interested at all.

I worked in hospitality for 5 years after graduating so that’s why I’m behind, and just now entry level at a corporate office. My last job though was in an office and much more responsible than my current job. However when I was applying for jobs I was aiming for $20/hr. They told me this job is $16-20, and gave me $16.50. They said they couldn’t go higher and I was pretty disappointed but I figured I’d apply to transfer ASAP. It’s now been 8 months and I’ve applied for 4 promotions. I talked to the Hr about 2 of them and neither time did I get to the actual interview, I really don’t know why.

I know there are other qualified people and maybe they think I should be here longer but my job is seriously easy and I’m bored, plus I can’t even afford to live on my own. I know my bosses think I’m always doing a great job. I’m constantly looking at jobs to apply for with a similar company too. I just feel so stuck and annoyed because I know I should be able to be making so much more. I guess I should be patient because I know I can move up eventually but.... it’s taking so long when I was already unhappy with the pay and I’ve learned everything in my position months ago. Also I feel like if I applied for jobs with a totally different company in a different industry I’d just be starting over again ?

763,UPDATE from the Suicidal Job Seeker!,307,dwutun,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dwutun/update_from_the_suicidal_job_seeker/,83,"[Here](https://imgur.com/a/nuB7sZu)  is my first post about hating my job to the point of suicidal thoughts.

Thank you to everyone who commented and DM'd me with suggestions, helpful tips, etc. I wanted to give a quick update on a few things:

I had a meeting with my supervisor because she said she noticed that I haven't been as ""enthusiastic"" as I normally am. She asked me what they can do better to support me and I told her ""pay me better wages."" She told me, unfortunately, they cannot do that and then told me that a few people on my team have been complaining because I come in around 9:15-9:20 instead of 9am on the dot and leave at exactly 5:30pm (our official stop time) instead of staying late till 6pm-ish like everyone else because they think it makes them look better.

I told her I honestly don't care and I am not paid enough to care. I couldn't fake it any more guys. I was very honest. She then said they will try and support me better and that I am a valuable member of the team. The whole fake spiel i'm sure every boss has said to someone in this subreddit at one time.

I am sitting here contemplating just quitting my job, to be honest. I'm not sure what I am going to do but I cannot take being here anymore. I just can't. I am leaving today at 4pm i don't care what anyone says. Screw them all.

The good news is I secured a part-time job for evenings and weekends that I can do to make more money while I look for another full-time job. I despise this place with the fury of a thousand suns. I pray that my hard work pays off and i can secure a better gig soon.

ETA on Nov 19, 2019: I quit today. My last day is Friday. I feel so so so much better already. Screw these people and their low pay. When they asked why I was leaving I replied ""The salary is way too low for what is expected of me. I honestly don't care anymore. Good luck with everything.""",1573871530.0,2019-11-15 21:32:10

765,There is something worse than being ghosted after an interview,313,c3gfsb,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c3gfsb/there_is_something_worse_than_being_ghosted_after/,97,"I have been applying to jobs for two years. 750 applications. 10+ appointments at career centers. 6+ job fairs. 15 interviews. Multiple part-time and contract jobs.

I’m a teacher and took a 1.5-year sabbatical with the intent to quit teaching entirely. I took a six-month position through an agency and realized I wanted to get back into it. I’ve had many interviews lately. 

The latest happened on Tuesday. I’d been contacted on June 7 by the principal of the upper school for an interview on June 13th, which I confirmed. Then, the principal of the middle school (where I’d actually be interviewing) told me it would instead be on the 18th. And it would be a group interview. So I was already super annoyed with the interview process.

But I prepared like crazy anyway. I researched the school and its philosophy for hours — probably about 8 hours total (it’s a classical school and I wanted to make sure I understood what that meant and how to frame my answers in the context of that school). I had six pages of notes prepared. 

I crushed the interview. My answers were strong and confident. I had more experience than the other candidates. At the end, the principal was making the most eye contact with me and speaking to me directly.

They said they’d “make a decision and let [us] know today or tomorrow” (meaning Tuesday the 18th or Wednesday the 19th).

This morning, I’d heard nothing. I assumed it was just another company ghosting me.

But around noon, I got an email that said: “I am excited to meet you PaHoua. Be on the lookout for a calendar invite.” It was from the upper principal, who I had not met nor interviewed with, but had extended my initial invite to interview.

It sounded a bit weird, but like a job offer! Like they’d skipped a step — like the middle principal had told him she’d hired me and he sent off that email before she informed me — but like I had the job!

I replied: “Does this mean I have been offered the job? I am overjoyed to accept and come down and meet the rest of the staff!”

Ten minutes. Ten minutes of happiness and relief I felt. That the job search had ended. That my preparation had paid off. That someone wanted my skills.

He emailed back. It had been a mistake. He’d been trying to reply to my earlier email from June 7th when they had to reschedule.

I’d have preferred to have been ghosted. This was a careless, cruel mistake. I feel hollow inside.

EDIT: No, I’m not planning to make a career move. After my last permanent teaching job ended in spring 2017, I vowed to never return to teaching again. 1.5 years and countless job applications later, I’d had no luck in other industries and I was forced to pick up short-call subbing again. I found that I still liked teaching and very quickly landed a six-month long-term sub gig. I decided to return to teaching permanently and have had interviews for 4 of the 7 teaching gigs I’ve applied for. 

No, I’m not planning to teach overseas.

No, I’m not planning to move. Because I haven’t been able to pay off my student loans, I have no credit and my wages are being garnished. I can’t find a different place because I would fail a credit check. My rent is $1049/month.

No, I can’t go back to school. See above.

Yes, not everyone would have interpreted the email the way I did, but that’s what happened. Others in my life agreed with me. 

Yes, it’s reasonable to have the level of despair I currently have and no, I don’t have any more hope.",1561179910.0,2019-06-22 01:05:10

I got an earful.",310,4lz4vg,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4lz4vg/update_i_suspected_my_toxic_coworkers_were/,50,"Link to original(https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4kza7c/i_suspected_my_toxic_coworkers_were_gossiping/)

First, I wanted to thank each and every one of you who took the time to comment and give advice. I read every one of your responses. They were all extremely helpful, inspiring, and comforting. I could not have gotten through the last week without your kind words. 

Many of you expressed dismay that I recorded the conversation. I live in a one party consent state. Before I recorded the conversation on my iPad, I consented to recording the conversation verbally, with a clear view of my face. The recording was made while I entered and exited the work room, with my iPad in my bag. I contributed to the conversation intermittently. It was while I was gone that the gossip was made. I'm not worried about the legalities at this point. 

Many of you expressed anger that I would subject myself to listening to what was said. I get it. However, when there is a weird vibe in the room, whispering, eye rolling, outright rudeness, exclusionary behavior which resulted in me feeling anxious and even idealizing suicide due to the harassment I experienced, then you might understand. It wasn't until I spoke to my husband and he said, ""so you're being bullied?"", that I understood the extent of the damage done to my self-esteem. It helped to put a label on it, that I was a victim of 'workplace bullying' and it was exacerbated by a negligent and clueless boss. 

So I started researching, reading articles, reading advise that you all gave and I felt as if a weight had lifted. My husband is in an executive position and he gave me amazing advice. One redditor recommended I get ultra professional and distant. So I did. No more staying late or offering to come on early, no more favors, friendly conversation or small talk. I shut down. The funny thing was that suddenly they became concerned, ""alittlepill, are you ok?"" to ""you're so quiet today"". Finally, after they were nearly bursting, they accused me of being in a bad mood. Lmgdao. I would just smile, keep working, cheerful with clients and my boss, but not my normal social self.  Then I started having fun. They loved them some Dunkin Donuts. I would usually bring donuts or Starbucks for everyone  and I just stopped cold turkey.  Instead, I would just walk in with a cup of coffee for myself. Petty, I know. My boss even commented one day that something was ""off"". The next day when her and I worked alone, she commented to me that it was so nice working alone with me and how at ease she felt. So, even she had begun to notice that the tension was not there when the other two were not around. 

So, today I could not wait to update you all. This morning, it was more tense than usual. Lots of whispering and my boss was gone. My boss called and I answered the phone. She asked me how  everything was going. I said fine, but I noticed that there was a lot of tension and whispering. I point blank asked her what was going on. 

The main bully gave her notice! 
I knew she was having personal problems and I guess she's moving in with her mom 4 states away! It definitely made my day and my boss sounded relieved.  The weaker bully has been wanting to quit too, so I'm sure she will leave soon as well now that her bitch buddy is leaving. Bye Felicia! 

So, that's the latest. I'll be promoted to the main bully's position now, but I'm still looking for another job, and my field is in high demand, so it's all good. ",1464778677.0,2016-06-01 06:57:57

Or if you're some butterfly effect godsend and can give me advice, oh gods, Please, PLEASE.

So I did my bachelor's in ecology in a fairly good university (Tartu, Estonia). I'm in my first year of an ecoinnovation master's, but took academic leave because I need an income reallllllllly badly. I've been casually keeping an eye out for jobs (both within the EU and in my country) for years now, and it's always been pretty bad for non-IT aligned folks here, but now it's just a job drought.

Most jobs relating to life sciences in any way seem to require either a master's, driver's license (which I don't have), or previous experience. I'm surprised, because it shouldn't be too hard to train an employee in lab-specific equipment or programs (what some uni courses do during master's).

I'm fully fluent in English (even in my field), so I figured I'd search in say, Sweden, where my partner lives, or in other EU countries, but it's only PhD candidate positions, postdocs' jobs, and positions that require a third language I don't speak.

I'm broke and probably going to feel the pangs of hunger and homelessness this year, but I don't need advice to stop eating avocado toast. I'm just wondering - do my brethren in fields of ecology/biodiversity have it as bad? If so, how are you surviving and where do you work?

Got a temp offer at a zoo I'm considering, but after taxes my expenses would leave me in the negatives. Guess it's better than being in worse negatives though.

If you got wisdom or offers or pro tips or hints, please help a peep out via PM. Just please say nothing if you're from outside the EU. I don't want to hear ""six figure salary"" ever in my life ever again, as the local average is about gotdang 14k EUR a year.",1581749644.0,2020-02-15 01:54:04
769,I just learned first hand why you shouldn't reveal your salary expectations upfront in an interview,314,dl915u,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dl915u/i_just_learned_first_hand_why_you_shouldnt_reveal/,104,"I recently got laid off and my last day is coming up so I've been frantically applying to places in my field. 

I had a phone interview with a large tech company here that I applied to, even though I didn't feel like i had a chance since tech companies here generally have crazy high expectations for entry level roles. 

At the end of the interview he asked me what salary expectations were for this role. I turned this question around on him and asked ""what is the typical salary range for someone in this role?""

To which he responded to me with $70 - $80K depending on experience. 

Mind you, I currently make $50K, and have been expecting (or should i say hoping) to finding a role that pays between $50 - $55K. In my field, entry level roles here are often offered even less than that. If i had revealed that to him, the salary range for this job would most likely been a lot lower had i told him. 

Granted, this was only an initial phone screening, (which went *really* well and im expecting to hear back from them soon), so nothing is set in stone yet.

But either way, i think this is a good reminder for everyone that you should never reveal you current  salary (illegal in some places) or salary exceptions upfront, because you never know what they may offer, and they might use your expectations to low ball you.

Since November 2018 I’ve been looking for permanent work and trying to go back for round two of grad school. I was waitlisted by one school, rejected by everyone else, and in spite of numerous positive last-round job interviews it wasn’t until this past Tuesday that I finally, finally got an offer for a permanent position. In short, my entire last year has been a world of rejection.

As so many folks in here can attest, this entire process is SO EFFING DEMORALIZING. I can’t even tell you guys the number of mornings I dragged myself out of bed and into the shower just to find myself sobbing over my inadequacy. I was actually doing some pretty cool things with my time, but the fact that I couldn’t get any traction— that I was good but not good enough— cast a black raincloud over everything. My temp position ended in March, and I was burning through my savings and terrified about what might happen when they ran out.

About a month ago I remembered an op-ed I read in the New York Times about a comedian/writer who went on a masochistic journey of trying to get 100 rejections in a year (I know so many of you have gotten WAY more than that). I thought a lot about what she learned during that process. What I drew from it was to start anticipating a no, and to let that expectation take some of the pressure off. When I finally decided that the last two jobs I applied to would be it until I was done with school applications in January, it brought a lot peace and acceptance. Not much hiring during the holidays anyway, right?

In the end, I made it to the final round for both, and got the offer from one (I withdrew my candidacy from the other so I don’t know what would have happened there). I feel like being less desperate to impress during interviews, not sugar-coating my weaknesses, and not overselling my strengths was what helped most.

I was given a fantastic offer today by the second company so I took it and am starting immediately, not sure what company #1's problem was but it's not MY problem! Thanks again!

&#x200B;

Hi all,

I interviewed for a position and we discussed full time and a range of pay. I was clear that I was not interested in part time or lower pay.

After over a month and a half of waiting, they sent me a *part time* offer of which the pay was significantly less than what I'd asked for and what we had discussed.

In the meantime I have gotten right up to the end of an interview process with another promising company - they are having me shadow in their office this week to see if I like the environment before accepting the job.

I professionally rejected the first employer's offer and cited that the reason was that I was looking at another position that was full time with higher pay, etc.

Their response was that they were so sorry, they had no idea I was looking for full time (???), and that they have other full time positions available with higher pay for ""more responsibilities.""

I am more interested in the second position for which I am about to shadow, but should I take the time to find out more about the ""full time"" positions at the first company? And how should I respond to them?",1548305147.0,2019-01-23 23:45:47
785,"PSA: Do not fear the ""salary requirements"" question. Be honest and know your worth.",301,8p1jww,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8p1jww/psa_do_not_fear_the_salary_requirements_question/,111,"I have been in the working world for over almost 25 years.  In that time, I have been involved in hiring decisions not only in information technology, but other positions within an organization.  One of the questions I see pop up here is how to answer the ""salary requirements"" question.  I thought I would write up a quick PSA for the members here.  I hope this is valuable to you.

Lets approach why a company asks this question.  Most organizations have an idea how much they want to pay.  Either they have a range or a top level amount.  This question is used to weed out candidates that are asking for too much.  

I will give you a example.  When I left my last position as a Director of IT, I was asked to review candidates for my position.  There was a dynamite candidate that had over 20 years of experience as a Director of IT in a large organization.  The problem was that he was asking for 250k a year, which was way more than a medium sized company wanted to pay.  

So, lets move to the candidate point of view.  When they are asked what their salary requirements are, they are unsure how to answer.  The best advice I can give here is to know what you are worth.  Don't base it off of how much you make now, but how much you should be making at the new job.  Know how much that job is paying at other organizations or in your area.  Know that your experience, or lack thereof, will be a major factor in that salary and adjust accordingly.

An example here would be a candidate that put in a application for the same Director of IT position and was asking for about 50k.  The candidate was an IT Manager for a small company that was looking to make his way up to Director.  This person was a solid candidate from an experience perspective, but the problem is that he didn't do any research on how much he was worth.  The company found someone better than he was and paid a bit more for a little bit better quality.  Could the company have hired the candidate asking for 50k?  Yes they could, but they decided to not go down that road.  Lowballing yourself is not a good idea.

So what is the best way to approach the salary requirement question after you know how much you are worth for the job?  Always give a range.  Make the bottom level of your range the minimum it would take for you to accept the job.  

Do not be afraid about being stuck at that range.  If you are early in the process, it gets the conversation started.  If you are at the tail end of the process, you have heard the requirements of the job and what the expectations of the company are.  If you say 70k-90k early in the process, and then the organization has higher expectations for the job later in the interview process or they have more responsibilities, you can change that range and adjust as needed.  Make sure that you clearly communicate why your range changes when the time comes.

A good example of this would be the same Director of IT position.  The person who got the job gave a range of 90k-110k.  The company chose to meet in the middle with the candidate and he took the job.  I know that he was making about 70k at his last job as a low level IT Manager, but I know that he was due a pay increase.

One of the common statements I hear is that you could be disqualified for a job if you ask for too much.  Do not be disappointed if this happens, especially if you have done your research.  An organization that wants to undercut and pay only 55k for a 70k job is an organization you do not want to work for.  Accepting a job that low will only be a stop gap for a candidate until they find something new.  Organizations that are paying that low know they won't be able to retain the employee for a meaningful amount of time. 

When you give your range of what you are looking for, be confident.  You know how much you are worth.  You know your experience and why you are worth that amount. Be ready to talk about it in your interviews.

I hope this helps!

TL;DR
Do not fear the salary requirements question.  Do your research on the pay range, know your experience, and give the company a range.  Make the low part of your range the minimum you would take.  Be confident.  Be ready to talk about how your experience relates to the job and why you are the perfect candidate.

Everyone is expected to fill out their time sheets as if they are doing work every minute of the day, as if no one ever takes bathroom or coffee breaks.

People still do take breaks anyway. The chatty Cathys make their rounds, and others talk to each other over IM all day. Smokers take smoke breaks and some others go out for coffee breaks. 

I'm just wondering if this is normal/standard for office work. Studies support that mental-based work benefits from periods of rest/breaks, and I would like implement it into my schedule - for example, going for a 10-15 minute walk every 2 hours of work, etc.

Is it unrealistic or unfair as a worker to spend 1 hour of the 8 hour work day on breaks?

I will be posting to r/personalfinance for advice. It appears LinkedIn has taken down that page and also the company Virtusa has not replied back to my emails - I'm thinking to write another strongly worded email to them. They should at least try to do something about this because it's happening under their name. I feel sorry for those 146+ unfortunate souls who applied to it. I'm doing this for them, Linkedin MUST and SHOULD send out emails to the people who applied to it warning them of this scam.

Repost from r/cscareerquestions I didn't know you can get scammed through LinkedIn postings too It appeared legitimate too. I hope others are made aware of this too.

Before I begin this is the posting [https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1601617420/](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/1601617420/) The poster has the same name as the original guy but has only 1 connection.

I have contacted the company Virtusa, don't know if they will do anything, I have reported it to LinkedIn I know they won't do anything.

I'm just another desperate grad looking tirelessly for a break and one faithful day I applied to a job just like the other hundreds I have in the past few months. Out of the poor 146 souls who applied I was one of them. Here are the events.

1. I get an email from [hrinterviewteam@gmail.com](mailto:hrinterviewteam@gmail.com) stating that an interview has been scheduled. This should have been the only red flag I needed. But I trust LinkedIn and set aside the flag. How can a job posting of a reputable company be a scam but oh boy was I wrong.
2. The interview was to take place on google hangouts - I was nervous- a video conference? I got up unusually early today had no breakfast still am hungry while writing this out.
3. I went online on time and started the conversation, the person tells me this will be a text-based interview - A second red flag I set this aside too. The usual conversation goes on things like ""tell me about yourself "" etc. I wasted 3 hours on this nonsense.
4. The person then says I have to wait for 30min - to an hour as he is sending my responses to the ""hiring board for review"" and they will tell me if I get the job or not. After 40min they say that I got the job. THIRD red flag - at this point I'm feeling confused. Is this that simple? Then sadly I set everything aside and am so happy finally this job-hunting ordeal is coming to an end.
5. Then they say they will send me some money so that I can buy office supplies - My Instincts suddenly took over me, my instincts which have been sharpened by browsing Reddit every day after I wake up and go to sleep and on the throne of the unspeakable. It was time to cash out my Reddit karma. I started asking questions and demanding that they show proof that they form the company. They provide vague answers. With the help of a friend, we figure out how this happened? How can a legitimate job posting on Linkedin lead to me almost getting scammed? Its because I didn't verify if the poster was legitimate.

So what did we learn today lads? Always check the poster's profile when applying on jobs through LinkedIn.

808,Leaving a Toxic Workplace: Lessons Learned A Year After Leaving,300,6gzdvj,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6gzdvj/leaving_a_toxic_workplace_lessons_learned_a_year/,69,"Hello /r/jobs. Over a year ago, I left a toxic workplace. I've spent a lot of time thinking about what happened, what I could have done differently, and what I learned. Below is a summary that I hope helps someone who is/ was stuck in a similar situation.

**Realizations**

I realized a few things about being in a toxic workplace:

1. **It's not you, it's them**. Due to the constant bullying, aggressive and erratic behavior, and sometimes outright [gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting), I started to feel like I was going crazy. ""Maybe I am just terrible at my job"", ""I'm incompetent"" were frequent thoughts in my head. After I left, I realized: I am not incompetent, I'm just like everyone else, good at some things, not at others, but for whatever reason this work environment is not allowing me to be successful and it's harming me. After I left, 40% of the company quit within 6 months; even if they didn't, I'd still know I made the right choice.

2. **Some people stay in toxic environments**. There were people who worked in my toxic company for 10+ years, who made me think I was the crazy one. Looking back, 2/3 of them all had strange health issues: migraines, anxiety, panic attacks, sick from work frequently. They weren't happy, healthy, or successful in that environment, they were *enduring* (and failing).

3. **Document EVERYTHING**. Save every email, every note, take notes on conversations, everything; back it up to a thumb drive every day. Start doing this NOW. You may be in a situation where they try to screw you over and it will come down to their word versus yours. Hopefully you never have to use it, but if you do, having extensive documentation will save you months of misery.

**Escaping A Toxic Workplace**

When you're in a toxic workplace, you have 2 options:

1. **Change the workplace.** If you're senior enough in the company that you have authority to restructure teams (including hiring/ firing), sweeping policy changes, etc. Then it may be possible (but still extremely difficult or impossible) for you to change the toxic environment. Then again if you match this description you are probably not seeking advice on Reddit for how to fix your messed up company.

2. **Leave.** Get out, no matter what it takes. In 99.9999% of toxic work environments, you have no power, authority, or ability to systematically root out the source of the toxicity and enact change that would turn the environment around. Staying in this environment and hoping it gets better is not only futile, it's a tool used by managers at toxic workplaces to string you along; they'll call a meeting with you, tell you they know you're not happy, and ask what they can do to fix it for you. It's possible they genuinely believe they can make it better for you, but unless they match the description in #1 above and are truly altruistic without ulterior motives (rare in toxic workplaces), things will not change - and think about it: they either already know things are messed up and have done nothing about it, or they had no idea and they're oblivious to how bad things are, either way the situation doesn't lend itself to actually changing.


**Taking Care of Yourself**

Your #1 priority during and after a toxic workplace is to take care of yourself, in all senses of the word: mental, physical, emotional:

1. **Talk to your husband/ wife/ partner**. Tell them what's going on and keep them informed. They aren't there to act as your therapist, but you will be going through a difficult time (dealing with the toxic workplace, stress of looking for jobs, starting a new job, possibly moving etc).

2. **Exercise and eat right**. Doesn't matter if it's going to the gym, spin class, or just getting out for a walk, get moving. Better yet, go for a walk at lunch so you get out of the workplace and out into the fresh air. Eat good food - it's tempting to stress eat and stuff your face with junk to make yourself feel better, but avoid this as much as possible as it will only make you feel worse in the long run, not better.

3. **Be aware of substance abuse**. While I was at my toxic workplace, I was chain-drinking coffee all day to keep myself energetic and focused, then drinking too much alcohol at night to bring myself down from the stress of the day and being amped up on caffeine. Looking back, this made the stress worse and the workplace more difficult to work with, not less.

4. **Talk to a professional**. If you can, talk to a therapist. It's not weakness, you aren't crazy, but you need someone in your life you can talk to that's a professional, not a friend or family member. If you had a gaping wound in your chest, would you shrug it off and not see a doctor? A toxic workplace can do just as much damage. Talk to somebody.

5. **Meditate**. I'm not talking about the power of crystals and woo-woo type stuff. I'm talking Mindfulness meditation that will help you calm your overactive mind and start to develop discipline for your own feelings. Go over to /r/Mindfulness and /r/Meditation to start.

**Moving On From a Toxic Workplace**

After you leave, it will take some time to feel 'normal' again, and you WILL feel residual stress and feelings left over from your toxic work environment. These things will take time (it took me 6 months), but you WILL start to feel normal again; give it time, and keep following the advice above under ""Taking Care of Yourself"".

**You will be stronger in the long run for having survived this kind of environment**.  You can get back from this experience. Take care of yourself. Good luck, and hang in there.",1497383805.0,2017-06-13 15:56:45
809,"My boss expects me to be available after my set working hours, and texts only me when there are others who work on the same project... how should I communicate that I'm not comfortable with this? Or should I escalate this to HR?",296,gwpbf5,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gwpbf5/my_boss_expects_me_to_be_available_after_my_set/,74,"Hi! Thanks for taking the time to read this- this is my first (salaried) job, and I don't know how to go about this...

I'm the main person on a project, but I have 2 coworkers who have worked on this project with me. We use slack at work, but I set my notifications from 8am-4pm (my set working hours); the 2 other people work 8:30am-4:30pm, and 9am-5pm.

My boss texted me at 4:55pm yesterday, asking me to make sure all project contacts were up to date in our tracker for invoicing/billing review. I was working out, so I told her I would get to it this morning. Today, she asked me to start working 9am-5pm while we were wfh, and I said no because I have commitments afterwards. She said I could compromise by keeping my slack notifications on until 5pm, and I agreed. But I feel weird about it-- even if she slacks me from 4-5pm, I'm not going to be able to get it done until 6-7pm, and there are 2 other people who can get whatever information she needs to her!

How do I communicate this to her (she's ridiculously sensitive)? Or is this something I could report to HR? If I can report it to HR, that would make me feel a bit more comfortable since I'm worried that she'd retaliate. If it's relevant, she hired my 2 coworkers because they were her friends, and she played favorites before this.

Edit: Okay, definitely not going to HR! Thanks for the great advice- I'm a hothead, so I really value outside opinions to make sure I'm not crazy. ",1591330763.0,2020-06-05 00:19:23
810,Landing my dream job after many rejections,298,dyvshw,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dyvshw/landing_my_dream_job_after_many_rejections/,47,"I have been applying for my first graduate role for the last 4 and a half months and have been facing rejection one after another with the usual rejection email saying ""unfortunately, we will not proceed with your application further"", or hearing nothing at all.  My dad was yelling at me everyday, saying that I am not doing anything these days and just wasting my time. I felt demotivated, felt like everyone was better than me, and felt like I would be stuck searching for jobs for a long time.

I believe everything happens for a reason. Last month, I saw this opening on linkedin for a graduate role at my dream company, being a reputable, top-tier multinational. The deadline was 11pm that day and I applied for it at 10pm on the same day. I did not think much of it as I have been getting a lot of rejections already from medium-sized firms. As this was a top-tier multinational, I was certain that there would be slim chance of me getting past even the first stage of the recruitment process. To my surprise, I made it to the final stage of the recruitment process. Yesterday, I had my second-round of interview, and just 1.5 hours after when I was drafting a thank you email to send to HR, I received a call from HR offering me the job and putting an end to my hopeless months of job searching.

In hindsight, I am glad that I got the rejections from the medium-sized firms. If I got through, then I would have never applied or tried for my current opportunity, and would not have gotten the job offer at my dream firm. This is my ideal opportunity and it came along when I least expected it. Good things take time.

Just thought that I would share my story and good luck to everyone searching!",1574248185.0,2019-11-20 06:09:45

\- I had a great career. i was making a lot of money and I honestly liked what I did.

\- But i had to quit on short notice because my ill mother whom i take care of broke her leg. she is a widow and I had to be there for her in her time of need.

\- No1 would hire me, I applied to hundreds of jobs on linkedin.

\- I finally got an interview with a roofing company..  I was so excited!!!!

\-The roofer guy turned me down for a rather bizarre reason. He claimed it was because i ""made too much money on my last job, and they dont offer that kind of money around here"" I told him I will work for minimum wage but he turned me down.

\-He probably turned me down because I quit my last job, i just wish he would have been honest with me.

\- I was so depressed that night... I went home and slept for 18 hours... i felt like the biggest loser on the planet and thought my life will be over soon.

\-I decided to give a temp agency a try.

\- Within an hour of walking into the temp agency they found me a job cleaning and sweeping for 15 bucks an hour... Its not as much as my last job but Hey it will be more than enough to pay my bills. (luckily my bills are rather small at this point in my life)

&#x200B;

I am so happy. I honestly thought i was going to die very soon.. thats how poor I am at the moment. I am glad I didnt give up though. If anyone has ever been in my situation I urge you to keep trying. Try a temp agency.. it did wonders for me..

814,Have you ever come to work and done nothing all day?,296,b9c3lv,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/b9c3lv/have_you_ever_come_to_work_and_done_nothing_all/,161,"I am feeling extremely unmotivated this entire week. Like a lot of people in this sub I’m looking for another job. The job I’m currently in is my first full time position out of college and I’m coming up on a year of employment in May.  I do not want to be here longer than a year. 

This job is not a good fit for me. It’s a desk job and I feel isolated, frustrated, and bored everyday. It’s gotten slightly better since I switched supervisors but I know I do not enjoy the duties of my job and don’t want to make a career at my current company. 

I took this job just to support myself so I wouldn’t have to move home  after college and until something else better came along, which I thought would be a few months max. I had leads on several jobs that I thought I would be hired for (from past internships/career networking) but none of them panned out.

Last week I had 3 Skype interviews all with different companies (one interview on Monday, one on Tuesday, and one on Friday)  and I’m hoping I at least get an offer on one. Right now I’m am waiting to hear back from any of them which is the worse part. 2 of the companies didn’t really give me a timeframe of when I could expect and answer but the 3rd did tell me they would have a decision in a week or week and a half. 

I’m really struggling at work to get anything done. It’s usually worse in the morning but I pick up by the afternoon. This week also seems like half of the office is out, including my supervisor (which can be a pain if I have a question or something I need approval on) I’m also getting frustrated with the girl who works next to me who’s doing the same job who consistently gets here at a 8:30 which I thought was late. (When I started I was told to get here at 7:45, which I did, but then I noticed everyone around me got here after 8am, even my supervisor, so I started arriving at 8) there’s something about it that irritates me. And I’m also just ready to be out of this job.

815,"I sent 32 patient charts to the wrong fax number. I'm done for, but how should I handle this?",297,8lkv24,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8lkv24/i_sent_32_patient_charts_to_the_wrong_fax_number/,91,"EDIT 3:


- The faxes went through, got a confirmation page with no errors. If it didn't go through, I would have gotten a report letting me know. IT is going to try and figure out the number.



- Fax machines may be outdated but that's what we use unfortunately. I don't know what to think about comments regarding how lame faxes are. We have a fax for outgoing and incoming faxes come into a folder on the computer, but we still have to print those so I don't see the point.



- I'm not getting fired, my supervisor said it would be ok. She said it happens and the worst I'll get is a corrective action, which I will gladly take if it means keeping my job. And no, I did not cry my way to forgiveness. I just couldn't control my intense fear of failure. 



- I didn't continue faxing to the wrong number after I found out, obviously. I didn't realize the number was wrong when I did them last week. Since then we moved to a new building. I just started back up on the project today and realized the number I had was different than the number on my paper. That's when I checked all of the previously faxed patient charts and freaked out. I didn't wait for a week, I didn't continue to fax to the wrong number, I didn't refax them because I wanted to think it through first. Yes immediate action is critical, but hasty decision making could've been worse for me.



I didn't go to my boss asap because I wanted to calm down. I wanted to gather all of the details so I could figure it out. Reddit helped me realize that I couldn't wait for hours. I knew what was important and that was enough to go to her.


If anyone in the future is looking at this because they did something similar, or because they really fucked up at their job, my advice is to calm down and jot down what you know. Get it straight. Then go to your supervisor and hear them out, they shouldn't care about your crying they'll care about the facts and the situation. It will be okk, because life is too short to dwell. I'll be sad for these next few days, and I'll feel ashamed for a while, but I can always do well in other areas of my job and eventually gain back that trust. It's okk. 




EDIT 2:


New people keep replying to tell me what I've already done. I appreciate the support and the advice but seriously, I DID come forward and I DID get this solved.

----


I've been at this medical records office about 2 months. I know how bad this is, huge HIPAA violation and I've put myself and my company at risk for a lawsuit. It took everything in me not to cry when I figured it out. I always check everything so carefully, this is like my worst fear becoming reality.




I sent the faxes on May 16, so it's been a weekish and my supervisor has not confronted me about it. It will eventually come out because the insurance company I was supposed to fax these patient charts to will ask where they are and she'll see.




I want to know what I should do though. Should I tell her now? I love this job but I'm pretty much positive I'll be fired for something this dangerously stupid. Should I quit so she can't fire me, and I won't have to tell future employers I was fired? Gosh I'm so sad.



EDIT:




Hello. I found out the mistake TODAY right before lunch which was at 12:30 for me. It's not my job to fax these, I cover for people who are absent or swamped. I did not cover this up for a week everyone.




I came back at 1:04. I told my supervisor and cried in her office. She was understanding and believed it was an accident. We sent the fax a letter asking them to contact us, we are resending the incorrect faxes tomorrow.

How do you stay motivated?",295,e5jpcv,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e5jpcv/did_the_right_thing_and_was_fired_now_back_to_the/,113,"My boss asked me to break the law and I said no. I was fired for it (I don't have money to pursue legal action). Now I'm back to applying and being disappointed.

I'm sure we all agree that applying for jobs sucks. I'm having trouble finding motivation to apply after my last experience. I'll see an opening, get excited, start the process, and just get less and less hopeful as it goes on. Why put myself out there when the right behavior is discouraged?

I hate applying to jobs. I was *so happy* when I was able to stop and support my family. Now I've got this stress of applying and not hearing back, not having money for my family, and just waiting to hear back from potential employers.

I've seen so many success stories here after people had been applying for over a year (which terrifies me). How do you all stay motivated through the rejections or ghosts? It's been two weeks for me and I'm struggling to even look at my resume.

Edit: I’ve seen your comments (thank you!) and I promise I’ll reply to them/answer questions, I just don’t have time (or a computer at the moment) to get to them now.

**Edit 2:** I've started replying to comments, but there are a bit more than I realized (and I've got a lot to do around the house, and jobs to apply to!), so I'm going to try to answer them all here:

* Leaving Glassdoor-type reviews - I fully plan on doing this, however it is a *very* small company, and it would be very easy to know I posted it. I don't know the laws about those types of things, but  u/lylachka mentioned someone getting sued, and *that* is not something I can handle (financially or mentally) at the moment. I'm most likely going to leave a review in a couple of months or after I get a job.
* Speaking with a lawyer/the DoL - I'm looking into speaking to the DoL; however, I have no proof of what I was fired for, only word of mouth from a couple of other employees. I am still looking into it though. I also have issues with stress and anxiety, so that's something else I need to take into account before I start this process.
* The law I was asked to break - for now, I don't want to be too specific, sorry :/ you can choose to believe if that part is true or not.
* Collecting unemployment - I am! I filed the day after I was fired.
* Audio recording - unfortunately I didn't think to record anything that happened that day. I'm also not aware of those laws in my state, so I don't know if a recording would even help me in this situation.
* Talking to HR/manager - this was a very small company, so it had neither.

And for all the advice I've gotten - Thank you! I definitely have some strategies now to not spiral into a bad spot during this process. Applying to jobs might just be one of my least favorite things (I'm sure it is for a lot of us). I'm thinking about volunteering too! There's a lot of parks around me that I think would be great for my mental health.

And as a final note - I don't think I'll ever work somewhere without an HR department ever again. This job was toxic as hell, and an HR department (hell, even a manager) would have solved all of that.

Thank you everyone for your responses! I'll try to reply to you at some point today, but if I don't I promise I've read them all and took them all into account.

I’m 28, have an MBA and work in marketing at a large university and have been for the last 3 years.  This past summer, I began looking to move up in my career. I started noticing that my peers were being paid more than me, even those that had been here a shorter amount of time. A couple months later, my boss left and I was given the interim tag to take over her role and get a promotion I really wanted. I had done good work, people liked me and I knew I was ready. I was even encouraged by the hiring manager to apply for the job.   I was left in charge of the department for about 3 months and many coworkers mentioned communication and other areas had improved greatly since I took over. All while still keeping up with my regular job duties. I was basically my own boss and doing two full time positions simultaneously. 

Well, we went through the actual search process and once again, I thought I did very well and my peers gave me great feedback. I was not promoted. Instead, they selected an external candidate with almost identical credentials to mine. I was shocked. Many of my coworkers were shocked. I was essentially told they didn’t think I was ready to be a manager and that had the other candidate not accepted, they would’ve failed the search and I would’ve remained interim with no chance at the full time job. Despite overseeing the department with nothing but positive feedback for 3+ months. 

I know I want to leave ASAP, move 800 miles back closer to my hometown and my fiancée/family. The problem is, I work in a highly competitive field (collegiate athletics) with not a ton of options. I’m also looking at jobs more tied to my “roots” in broadcasting/media/journalism.  

Going to work at my current job is almost physically painful to me at this point. Why should I continue putting in the effort somewhere where I am clearly not appreciated? I’m tempted to submit a letter of resignation and just accept being unemployed. Except I cannot afford to be unemployed, especially 900 miles from any support system. 

Any advice on how to move on and how to take advantage of this situation quickly is appreciated! 



Update #1: I Have been applying to jobs back near family and slowly backing down to doing the bare minimum at work. New guy started yesterday. He recognized me from professional social media things I’ve done and immediately started asking me questions and was very earnest to learn. Today was our 2-hour meeting of me catching him up on where we are and offloading projects to him. At one point he said to me, “so for the last 4 months you’ve been overseeing every sport, the staff, and most of our accounts on top of your normal job? Good god, how are you still alive?” He genuinely seems like a smart and personable guy, but that bit of fear he experienced thinking about being in my shoes was incredibly satisfying to me.

The stressful environment comes home into my personal life.

For a small time period at my last job, I worked with a manager who was an exception to the culture. In one-on-one meetings he was very supportive and encouraging. He was always happy to complement my work in front of others. Because of him, I was motivated to do good work and in turn I wanted to support him.

Should I just ignore this requirement and write a normal cover letter? Should I inform the company that this is illegal separately, or in the cover letter? Should I just bite the bullet and do it?

It’s now been 9 months, and since the 6 month mark I’ve been nudging my manager to get the ball rolling with this, but every time they say they’ll look into it or chase it up with senior management, nothing comes of it. I had accepted that the review might be put on hold in light of coronavirus (the 6 month mark was just a few weeks before the situation got bad in my country), but my manager throughout this time has assured me that this isn’t a problem, and the review is still going ahead.

833,I quit my job.,292,8lcxzj,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8lcxzj/i_quit_my_job/,46,"I made two posts before about how bad my job was so I wanted to let everyone know that I ended up quitting my job. With no notice. I gave my resignation letter and left.

The company decided to hire someone new and I decided, after he came on, that I would leave. So I began applying. I took a day off (my first day in six months) to interview at a new company. Later that evening my boss asks if she could call me. I said of course and it was a pleasant call. She was being very sweet, kind and let me know we had an early morning meeting to address how overworked I am. I was relieved because I was overworked. I dropped a lot of stuff to help her get her projects finished. She said ""I think, with you being overworked, the quality of your work has suffered. And I want you to know I am here to make you successful."" Like, no duh my work has suffered. I put your stuff first cause, as my boss, that's what you told me to do. 

Right before bed that evening, I decided to check my emails and apparently, while I was out, an email got sent out to clients with two mistakes and shit hit the fan. I had 65 emails in the course of 8 hours. My boss's boss decided to deduct $500 from my check for the mistake. 

And that was it. 

The final straw. 

I took a huge pay cut for this job and $500 deduction meant almost half of my paycheck. 

So I went in early, returned my stuff and left. I was up really late that evening crafting an email and resignation letter. I came home and went to bed.

Obviously, they didn't take it well. Everyone that worked there was a part of their family/friend network. Because they only hired friends (the cronyism was rampant) they were personally offended I left. They kept badgering me nonstop. Would I reconsider? Would I come back? Why am I doing this? I am so unprofessional. Never have I had this happen to me. 

I tried to be professional but after a while of constant calls and emails and not paying me (they still have paid me my last check) I let them know why I left. 

My boss emailed me back and she was so incredibly nice I cried. It was a wonderful opportunity spoiled by inefficiencies. 

So they made some changes, apparently.  

They fired the CEO's smug, lazy, inefficient son-in-law and are apparently doing better at hiring practices because the new guy they hired has a ton of relevant experience.  

I reached out to my last company and I have a new role in a better department making more than I did at this company. I'm grateful for the experience and I am happy I took a risk but sometimes you gotta cut your losses. If it is affecting you to this degree, start making moves to get the fuck out. I'm getting married this year. I can't be so unhappy that my job consumes everything. I didn't like the person it was making me. I was angry all the time. I was stressed and tired. I snapped at my fiance constantly. I gained weight and never wanted to exercise. I drank more and worked more. I'll be 30 this year and that is no way to live.

The day I quit, it was the best sleep I have gotten in a long, long time. That was a few weeks ago and I remember waking up intermittently and it was raining and I could hear the rain on the roof and I can't remember a time I felt so calm. So happy. My future husband took me out to lunch and it honest to god felt like a fresh start.

My response? ""My personal facebook page operates under a slightly modified version on my name, contains no employment information, and is primarily used for politics and discussion in various political groups.

It actually hit the highway our building is on but not the building itself. But nonetheless traveling to and from would have been even more dangerous. I was already there. After the tornado passed the owner and his wife showed up. They kept complimenting me while making back handed remarks about all the employees that called in (even though they are teenagers and their parents didn’t let them go in.) 
When my shift ends usually as long as I have my checklist completed I can leave. My husband and daughter came to pick me up and ordered carry out for all three of us. (that was already ready) I was supposed to get off at 8 but they frequently ask people to stay later. Usually I am told at the beginning of a shift however or at least an hour ahead of time if I will be working an entire extra hour. I folded my last set of boxes, and said I needed to clean three tables before I clocked out and that I would clear the salad bar before I left if they wanted me to. (Since the closer called in and that’s literally the only thing there was left to do.) The owners wife responded to that statement by laughing in my face and saying “why would you think you would get to leave.?” I said because I’m scheduled for 8 and no one told me I would be staying until 9 (closing). She said you should have assumed that since you were the only employee that showed up. I said that’s not how that works. (Shift leader) should have told me I was going to be closing. Also she and her husband were there “helping”  even though she doesn’t know what she is doing she could have handled an hour especially since there aren’t usually many orders in the last hour. My usual managers were not present. The owner told her to let me leave. I said I can finish my job first like I was planning to do (the tables). And she said no you’re done. I said yeah I’m done I’m turning in my notice.
I have a job that I’m supposed to start in three weeks but I’m only 90% sure if I got it or not. But I absolutely was floored at the disrespect after risking my life for some f’ing cheese sticks. (Also while I was at work the tornado jumped my house where my daughter and husband were and I was not with them over the most inessential job ever.)

I spoke to multiple people I know who are at this company, and they all said they were hired that same way. They said they had no more than two formality interviews before they got hired.

I went through the first interview fine. Then I was told I would go through another one to meet the team. That went fine, but I was told that not everyone who needed to be there was present. So they scheduled me for another interview. Then were an hour late and rescheduled it. Then they actually hung up on during that interview before the president got a chance to speak, so I had to make another interview. Then that was rescheduled twice. After all was done, the president said he wanted to hire me and to look for an offer in the next hour.

Instead of receiving an offer, I got a ""Subject"" \[blank subject title that just said ""subject"") ""we're sorry applicant \[name\] (it said name instead of my name) we decided to go with someone else"" through the application software.

850,**UPDATE** I reached out to a friend to help with interview tips. A few hours later I received an email from HR that I have been disqualified for ‘canvassing’,292,8g8uet,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8g8uet/update_i_reached_out_to_a_friend_to_help_with/,103,"I have an update. As suggested, I reached out to HR hoping to clear things up using the example /u/livingwithghosts had provided. Yesterday I received a pretty short and standard response: the decision was discussed and was final, wishing you the best in your future. The first interview was supposed to be last week on Wednesday and since I had written the email last week on Monday and hadn't gotten a response by interview time (until Monday yesterday, a week later) I didn't feel too bad and had pretty much moved on.

The email was sent from a typical organization one i.e. recruitment@xxx.org. However, a few individual emails had been carbon copied in the email I received. I have no idea why they did not BCC. I was curious so I decided to check them out. Forgive me guys I am bored and unemployed so I have a lot of time on my hands. 


During my research I had checked the organization's website where it had listed all senior employees so I was familiar with some names and could pretty much deduce their work email addresses. I decided to check the guy I initially reached out to Facebook' page (we have mutual friends so it wasn't hard to find). Lo and behold, he is dating one of the employees whose name/email ID was among the ones carbon copied in my email. She was also listed on the website.


I know that doesn't mean much and doesn't prove anything but I burst out laughing at the ridiculousness of the whole situation. Sometimes the easiest answer is the correct one. 

Some of the comments were of the opinion that I must have said something to him on Twitter that were canvassy. Twitter has a limit, my exact words were: 'yo dude I have an interview at your place, any tips for me?' 

There it is, just one of life's silly situations.

I had a total of 55 applications for my position.  One of my questions before a candidate could submit their resume was ""How many years of experience do you have?"".  

Since indeed sends you resumes as attachments, I checked out a few candidate resumes in my email.  Later in the morning I logged in and used a filter to isolate the people with 7 or more years of experience.  I noticed that the 3 candidates that caught my eye in my email did not show up on the list.  I thought it was something I was doing wrong so I reset the filter and tried again, this time only selecting one filter option ""10+"".  Still those candidates which had answered the question with 12 & 13 years did not come up.  

I started to realize the problem wasn't me.  I reset it again but this time I selected all the filter options \[from 0 years experience to 10+\].  Since I selected all the options I should have a list with all 55 candidates.  However, I had a list of 37 candidates -- literally, 18 people just didn't exist once I used the filter.

I called indeed support and spoke with a rep.  She logged into my account and replicated what I did with the same results.  She apologized and claimed that this was a beta feature and only 10&#37; of employers have access to this feature.  Filtering is in beta?  WTF?  Firstly, I'm not buying that something as standard as a ""years of experience"" filter is only now being introduced to indeed and secondly, why is it not labeled as such so employers know not to use it or to expect undesirable behavior.

I'm just writing this post to make employers and job seekers alike aware.  If you're an employer, you might be missing some valuable people if you're using an indeed filter.  If you're a job seeker, you may not even be seen by the employers.",1531435856.0,2018-07-12 18:50:56

I wouldnt say i suck at it, but im not great either. I need a lot of help all the time and makes mistakes that should be obvious that i shouldnt do in my field, it's frustrating and embarassing that im not doing well at my job even though i really want to. Since the bank is so big, and my team is almost at the core of everything functioning well, theres some pressure to perform accordingly. Although my colleagues are very nice i feel like i am a disappointment to them. I thought it would get better after some time and i would start performing well but im not. There is some improvements but not enough. 

I work in a lot of different projects, one day i am building a solution in sql while the next day im doing c# for a webapp and i never really learn one language well enough that im comfortable doing it. 

It wasnt so bad until  maybe 4 months ago, when we got a new colleague (also fresh on the job market). He also had a bit of a slow start, but he is already doing better than me and people rely on him for getting stuff done. No one relies on me like that. And the daily standup meetings has become only anxiety for me as he progresses and im stuck. The reason why im writing this now, is because im feeling so down and almost giving up since he solved an issue ive been trying to solve for WEEKS. he solved it in maybe 7 hours.

I dont want to show up at work, i feel anxiety and showing signs of not doing well mentally because of work lately. i dont want to quit because i hope i can get better like him soon, but at the same time im afraid i wont ever be. If I want to be great at programming, i think staying at my job is key since there's a lot of opportunity to learn different languages.

Also, i'm a woman and there's like 3 other women in my department. I feel like i have a lot of pressure to prove that I can do well in my field as a woman.

860,I finally did it! Unemployed for a year and took a risk that will pay off,286,dk9y7w,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/dk9y7w/i_finally_did_it_unemployed_for_a_year_and_took_a/,51,"I've never posted here before but I want to share my story and hope it might help inspire some of you who went through similar situations or are still in the job hunt.

A little bit of background about me. I graduated in May 2018 with a Bachelors in Economics. During my undergraduate years, I didn't go out much nor did I really pursue any real opportunities. I did not hold a single job but was involved in some of the student clubs so I had that going for me. I spent a lot of my years in my room playing video games (I still do) and really avoided anything that could land me an internship because I was afraid of rejection. As a result, I didn't have a resume up until my junior year and at that point, I still was reluctant to look for things. Time went by fast and before I knew it, I was a senior with no internship experience and literally zero job experience in my life. I did have some activities though such as some of the clubs I was in but that was it. Alongside that, my GPA wasn't exactly the best, higher than a 3.0 but not by much.

After graduation, I started applying for jobs. I knew I wanted a job in the financial services or tech industry. Initially, I was a bit delusional and thought I could land a solid job but my expectations quickly faded as weeks went on without a single response back. After a month of applying endlessly, I realized that the job hunt process was tiring and brutal but I pushed on. I used LinkedIn, Indeed, and all sorts of different job boards to apply and look for jobs. I tried to get out at least 10 applications a day before I went back to playing video games and this went on until September of that year where I would get my first interview. Because I had no interview skills, I ended up not making it past the first round. Over the course of next few months, this cycle would repeat where I would send out many applications and maybe 1 would get back to me. Sometimes even after getting back to me, I would get ghosted or not do well on the interviews. This went on for sometime and I started feeling helpless as I had to start paying my loans and did not have the means to do so. The only positive side of all of this was that I was living at home and all the jobs I was applying for was in my city (NYC). Instead of applying for some retail jobs to make some money, I was determined to land something I wanted and kept sending applications out mindlessly.

By this point, roughly 7 months had passed by and I had several interviews but couldn't convert any to an offer. I did start to get pretty good at them but I still didn't know why I wasn't getting anything. I was getting desperate and embarrassed and I eventually looked into my school's one-year MBA program. I was worried because I had loans and my family was in a bad financial situation. However, my parents were very encouraging and after consulting a lot of my friends and family, I decided to pursue it. I saw it as a second chance to take all the opportunities I had missed as an undergrad but I knew I would have to really try for it.

I'm currently a few months in and I graduate from my program in May 2020. I have attended many different career events and have done a lot compared to what I had done as an undergrad. I finally have received an offer a few days ago and it feels like a huge boulder has been lifted off my shoulders. The offer exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be more happy with it.

I wanted to share this story because I know how brutal the whole job application can be. The last year had been hell for me but it did teach me a lot about the whole process. In the end, it really can be a numbers game and luck does play a factor. For those who are still out there looking, I want you to know that you're not alone. There will be always be up and downs and it takes a lot to push forward but at the end of the day, you only need to land one job. I know my story isn't unique but I know that some of you can relate and push forward.

865,An update to my current job (how I jumped from a 29k job to a 90k job in 2 years with 0 experience),287,3d9hwv,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/3d9hwv/an_update_to_my_current_job_how_i_jumped_from_a/,84,"Hey guys, so I felt like I should update my current career status from the last reddit post I made less than 2 years ago, and how this career has taken me. 


**link to old post that I made a year and half ago:**
https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1o5ntf/this_is_my_story_from_0_coding_experience_to/


Basically a short summary from my previous post was that I was just a technical support with almost no career future, a dead end job that was paying me 14$ an hour (so about 29k a year). I wanted to go for other higher paid job but I had no skill and my bachelor degree was useless (it was some general study field...) and I barely graduated with 2.0 GPA......Then I decided to teach myself how to code during my free time without going to school for about 10 months (I slacked sometimes, so if you go hardcore on it you should be able to do it in 6 months I think or even less), also made a small game during the process and slapped that on my resume along with all the skills I had learned (also game wasn't even finished lol, it was just a showcase demo). Then I was immediately hired by a software consultant company in Virginia getting paid **60k**.


Now as for where I am now, I am still with the same company and will be making **90k** at the start of the August, and let me tell you how I reached this far from almost 0 **professional** coding experience in less than 2 years. 


When I started working for that consultant company, they gave you a really intensive training with some of the most demanding framework technologies on the market. For about 2 months I had to constantly keep up and learn those new stuff and it was tough; but in the end I was about to get through them and completed a couple assignments they gave out. After that they ship you out to various projects (mostly government) and I got onto ObamaCare as my first real project. It was a pretty new experience for me and there were a lot of things I didn't know about, but I was able to talk to my team and eventually got a good understanding on how things work and the tasks that they gave out were actually not that hard... So I stayed there for about a year and my pay only went up to **65k**, which was not that high. Then I realized that for the stuff that I do, I was getting way underpaid, so I asked for a raise from my employer, but they said wait till next year and they will give me a huge bump... As soon as I heard that I was pretty disappointed and pissed, so I just decided to start looking elsewhere with my newly updated resume. 

You will be surprised on how much the software market demands a developer with lots of framework experience under their belt. (Keep in mind that I only have about less than 2 years experience now) Anyway, as soon as I updated my resume on indeed.com and monster.com I was swarmed with recruiter calls. It was getting way out of hand that I had to turn my resume private in just 2 days. With just enough recruiters that I could handle, they immediately setup interviews for me and I failed a bunch since some of the things were pretty technical on the UI side, but eventually I passed about 3 interviews and got 3 offers. 1 of them was offering **83k** from Florida that allows you to work from home, except it was 6 months contract to hire with 0 PTO....the other 1 was local and was offering **90k** and also offers top secret clearance which is great (except their benefit sucks ass, it was with Obamacare....lol).


So with that in mind, I emailed my employer and told him that I have a choice. I can leave the project right now and go with those offers or I could stay if he can raise up the bar for me. Since I really like my current project and my team, I thought to myself that I could stay if he give me a decent raise.


About 2 hours later after I sent that email, I got a call from him, and he said that he will match the offer and starting August, I will be getting paid 90k. (a 25k jump...haha, but seriously, I could’ve asked for more) 


And redditors, this is my current situation on my software developer career path that I picked up in less than 2 years ago, from a **29k** to a **90k** jump. Oh and did I mention that **I love my job**. (and I get to work from home once every week) 


All I can say is find something you like, then get motivated and learn it. Though I can't tell you anything about any other fields, but as for Software Developing field, it's the cheapest career to pickup that can turn into the most profitable job. My old highschool friend who motivated me into doing it now is making about 250k in Silicon Valley as a senior IOS engineer...so yeah. I'm not at that level yet, but I will reach there :)


TL;DR, in less than 2 years, I was able to jump from a 29k job to a 90k job as a software developer with 0 coding experience.

**edit**, formatting
Also the language I work with is Java 

**edit 2**, so I learned my basic java through thenewboston tutorials. After you have the basic knowledge on the language, you should be able to enter any junior positions. As for mid level developer position, it will be nice to know frameworks, so I recommend follow java brains channel on youtube:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYt1sfh5464XaDBH0oH_o7Q

The popular framework on the market that I learned were Spring and Hibernate

also learn some SQL too if you have the chance


**edit 3**, I can't really show any other prove unless I disclose anything personal and work related, so the best I can do is provide 1 of the offer letters that I got with the 90k salary

http://i60.tinypic.com/zwdgea.png

Sorry that I had to block the name of the company due to confidentiality

**edit 4**, as for what advice I can give to fellow future developers is, make your resume as impressive, descriptive, long as possible. Recruiters usually look for keywords, if you have the skill on there, they will grant you interviews.

After you get interviews, look at the job description and make sure that you know well enough on the ones that are required. Then just do your best. You will fail **A LOT** at first (that's what happened to me). Don't give up, just learn from your mistakes. Know how to answer them next time if they arise.

**edit 5**, 1/5/2016, so last month I ended up leaving that consulting firm and joined the 90k offer job, except that I was able to negotiate the salary up to **110k** :D

Has anyone else had a similar experience?,284,9n5lp7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/9n5lp7/lowball_salary_offer_and_a_blatant_grab_for_free/,153,"Just finished typing up a LENGTHY email on why I would not be continuing the application process.

I am just so sick of these shoddy companies trying to take advantage of the current... job market. I feel like I get an interview, I go through all the hoops, and BAM I realized I wasted all my time.

This company is located in a HCOL area where I could likely pull in 100k+ for my current experience level. Now, I would have taken 75k, maybe in 72k, since it's a startup. But 50k? In an area where apartments are 3.5k at a minimum. I don't think so.

Don't get me wrong, 50k is reasonable. **In Cleveland.**

The real nail on the head was a blatant grab for free work. A ""sample project"", start to finish, that would likely take me 40hrs to complete and would be (best part) totally usable by the company for future endeavors. Guys, I get that people do sample projects, but this wasn't Google or anywhere well-known. 

Long-story short I sent out a nicely worded email detailing my reasons for withdrawing my application. I listed salaries based on years of experience, told them how much I made in my last position, and what salaries similar companies (didn't give names) have been throwing around, and called them out for the free work grab.

God, I just want to give up. I loved the company but I'm sorry I am not eating ramen every night and living with 8 roommates to work there. 

Who else has had this experience? I need a hug. ",1539250544.0,2018-10-11 05:35:44
869,What are the smart things we should be doing for job-hunting that we aren't in 2019?,285,e7yyt7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e7yyt7/what_are_the_smart_things_we_should_be_doing_for/,152,"So internet job-hunting seems to be a giant bloody waste of time. Lots of time uploading resumes and then having to copy the same information into redundant forms on their site only to never hear anything back. Job boards all contain duplicated listings, the employment agencies seem to only be able to place people who precisely fit pigeon holes and fail at complex placements. 

So, no use doing the same thing that's not worked in the past and expecting different results. What are actual smart ways to get noticed? I see networking events with professionals in your industry listed but there's not a lot of those going on in my area and that seems to be more of a long-term investment. 

There's talk about cold calling and cold emailing the relevant people in local companies you target but that doesn't seem to generate much of a result, either. 

How are the smart kids doing it these days?",1575865763.0,2019-12-08 23:29:23
870,My Experience With TopResume,283,8jtsng,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/8jtsng/my_experience_with_topresume/,66,"My hope is that by sharing this, I may help someone else who finds themselves in a similar position. 

I’m mid-level manager for a large organization. It’s a great job. But, like with any great job, it’s got a couple issues that sometimes are tough to reconcile. A month or so ago, being a little worried about my tenure with my employer, I decided to start testing the job market again. This time around, given my current mid-level position, I was obliged to begin targeting senior-level roles. Problem was, I had no idea how to market myself as such. I updated my resume and sent it out to a few prospects. I was dismayed to find my applications being roundly rejected each time I applied, even for roles that were more lateral than vertical.

I came across TopResume when I uploaded my resume to Glassdoor. They ask, “Would you like a free professional resume evaluation?” Having never had my resume reviewed by a “professional”, I decided to try it. Within a day, I received what I thought was a thorough review of my resume. It was pitched as having been reviewed by a human. It included some sort of evaluation that tells you how an ATS analyzes your resume and an interpretation of those results. Mine said my resume portrayed me as someone who worked in brand management, that I didn’t have enough keywords to bypass an ATS, and that the design was “visually uneven”.

So I followed the prompts to check out their pricing. After some internal back and forth, I decided it wouldn’t hurt to purchase their executive package ($350) which includes the resume rewrite, a LinkedIn rewrite, and a cover letter. I figured it was an investment in myself. 

My experience working with the writer was professional but admittedly underwhelming. My resume was sent back to me repackaged and distilled, which I guess was the point. The problem was, though, that no huge undertaking was made to present me as a senior-level applicant. Some keywords were added, some formatting changed. But otherwise, it was still the same resume that I submitted, but somehow less. My original resume was robust, detailed, exhibited my portfolio and online publication contributions. The new resume did none of that. It was bland, unengaging, and standard. It stood out in no way from any other resume I’ve ever seen.

After several iterations of back and forth, we settled on a resume format and content. At this point, I decided to resubmit my resume to see what TopResume’s ATS evaluation picked up. Recall that the original critique said the design was uneven, that I didn’t have enough keywords, and that apparently I was a brand manager. 

For the experiment, I used an alternative email. Just like my original resume submission, within 24 hours, I received a critique. To my surprise, the critique that came back regarding this new resume was the EXACT same as the one I received for my original resume. Word for word, line for line. It said my format was again “visually uneven”, that I need more keywords, and so on. Literally a word for word copy of my first critique, except the resume in question had been overhauled by one of their resume writing “experts”. And, according to their critique, it still lacked keywords. It also still labeled me as a brand manager. Again, the word “brand” was nowhere to be found in the resume itself.

Angry, I called TopResume. As a matter of practice with things like this, I recorded the call. According to the representative, TopResume’s software is the one that does the initial critique, not a human. Although, the email you receive containing the critique is from a person with a signed name, a firstlast at topresume domain email address, and they use personal pronouns throughout the critique. Continuing, the representative explained that their software is able to recognize that it’s the same person and as such its critique output will be the same for six months after the first resume’s submission. He said they routinely discourage customers from toying with their system like this (wonder why). 

How would the software, unless it is intelligent which I doubt, know that these are the same people between two resume files? Of course the name is the same, but the software should treat them uniquely since names can often be identical. Even then, the format and content should have been largely changed as part of the service I paid for, right? So how would the software connect the two? I paid money to have it completely rewritten, but the final version was so similar to the original that the software was unable to tell the content difference. Either way, TopResume’s service is lying. The representative assured me I’d receive a return call from a supervisor. The call never came.

I spoke with an attorney who advised me to call the FTC and submit a fraud complaint. According to this attorney, the FTC is especially interested in online coaching fraud such as that which TopResume apparently engages in. Additionally, I disputed the charge from TopResume with my banking institution. 

In the end, be careful out there, folks. We’re all just trying to get to the next stage in our careers and there are predators out there looking to exploit that.",1526494599.0,2018-05-16 14:16:39

872,As the person who has to collect resumes and cover letters for my team: pleaseeee help make my life easier.,285,4sh9au,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/4sh9au/as_the_person_who_has_to_collect_resumes_and/,91,"I'm the person who manages the xyzjobs@organization.com email account for my team. We've had to hire a couple of times in recent months, and every time we get hundreds of resumes, almost always from new college grads because they're entry-level positions.

I always take the time to reply to every single person who applied to confirm that we received their application. When people email to follow up, I always reply to tell them where we are in the hiring process, even if they were never selected for an interview. Which is why I think it's fair that job applicants could help make my life a little easier, too, such as:

- Not naming your resume RESUME_0712 or jd_cv_cw_edits or something to that effect. Please have your full name in the file name, and preferably at the beginning of the file name. This makes my life so much easier when I have to save all resumes in one folder and alphabetize them for my manager.

- Please don't contact me to see if there are any updates before the application deadline has even hit. I can promise you there have not been any updates. The hiring manager hasn't even come back from vacation yet.

- Please don't email me and say something vague like ""I am extremely interested in this position and I would like to learn more."" Umm, ok? What do you want from me exactly? Are you asking to have an informational coffee meeting or do you just have some questions that I can answer via email? I get that they probably read this from some half-assed career blog and thought it was a good idea, but it's really not.

- If the job clearly states that it is based in an American city, and your resume says you live and work in another country, and your cover letter says absolutely nothing about whether you're planning to relocate to our city or if you want to telework from your country... It suggests a complete lack of awareness and just creates confusion for us.

- EDIT: Don't start your cover letter with ""Dear Sirs."" Just WTF? WTF? I've seen this so many times from non-native speakers.

I also have some tips:

- If I email you and ask if you're available for an *in-person* interview that same day or the next day... RUN! This is a huge red flag. It means that the recruiting team is made up of highly narcissistic individuals who have no idea that this is extremely unprofessional to ask of applicants. It doesn't matter if the organization is highly regarded, like my employer is. If they ask you to come in with very little short nice, and if they fail to call you for a phone interview and don't even apologize... huge huge red flags.

- There are a lot of things that should never be in your cover letter. It's OK if you want to get a little personal, like ""I'm originally from Canada but moved to X state for college"" or ""I enjoy snowboarding in my free time."" That's all fine. But we don't need to know that you are an only child, or that you are ""good at English"", or that you just got divorced... TMI.

- So I know that a lot of people just use the same cover letter for every job... but if your cover letter is literally all in Arial Size 10 except for the name of the position, which is in Times New Roman Size 12, that is just next-level laziness.",1468362588.0,2016-07-12 18:29:48
873,"After 6 months, 120 applications, 21 interviews, I landed a job. Thanks r/jobs and here’s my story (stats +tips)",286,1v2uck,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1v2uck/after_6_months_120_applications_21_interviews_i/,42,"It wasn’t easy comrades, but I’m back in the labor force. I’ve been working for over a month now and have been meaning to share my trials and tribulations with the hardy people of r/jobs. There are some great people on this subreddit and the community has helped not only myself but countless others. 

Before I begin, I just want to say that **every rejection, every misstep, and every heartache- and trust me, there were plenty- I encountered along the way made me stronger**. I strived to learn something from all my interviews and constantly looked for ways to improve my presentation, interview ability, resume, personal and mental health, cognitive abilities, and my holistic happiness. One redditor on here- I tried to find your post and damn was it good-compared the labor market to the trials of sisyphus. **You’re doomed to linger at each stage until you pass each test along the way**: application, follow up, interview. With enough effort, persistence, and reflection, you will find a job. I know that doesn’t mean much from a random redditor but it will happen and likely when you least expect it. 

About me: 26, B.A. History, 2 years of internship experience in government/law, 2 years experience in non-profit advocacy. 

The Story: My organization was faltering and I was required to take a severe pay cut. After applying and working for 3 months, countless promises of my pay restored to its original level, and a toxic work atmosphere, I quit. I was unemployed for 3 months until I found my current position. 

Number of Applications: 120 

Number of Interviews: 21 (across 12 organizations). 
Number of Interviews at networked positions: 5 
Number of Interviews by bulk website application: 7 

Number of job offers received : 1 via bulk application 

Websites I used: Craiglist, Idealist, NYFA, Mashable, Mediabistro. 

My approach to The Trials (finding a job)
I. Daily habits
II. Tracker 
III. Know your story and what you’re looking for 
IV. Resume, Cover Letters, Digital Portfolio, and Linkedin 
V. Follow up
VI. Networking
VII. Addressing your needs and finding your balance (intellectual, physical, happiness, burnout)
VIII. Interview 
IX. References 

**I. Daily Habits**

**I can’t stress enough the importance of routine.** While I was unemployed, I woke up at the same time and, for the most part, ended my day at the same time. I created a daily schedule on a whiteboard that I followed religiously throughout my trial. I have since erased my board but it went something along the lines of this: 

8:30-9-:00 - Meditate
9:00-9:30- Eat, Shower
9:30-11:00- Openware courses, blogging, read literature (this was my study component)
11:00- 1:00- Apply to positions
1:00-1:30- Lunch
1:30-5:00- Apply to positions
5:00-5:30- Network 
5:30-6:00- Decompress
6:00- 7:30- Gym
7:30-9:00- Eat and Shower
9:00- 12:00- Read & write/ Go out

I also set weekly goals for myself such as volunteer once a week, apply to 6-10 positions, write 3 times a week, etc. Routine is your friend and it’s so very easy to fall into the trap of lounging around. Lethargy is insidious and can easily derail your application momentum. 

**II.Tracker**

I created a simple excel sheet in which i transcribed when I applied, where i applied, and the address and phone number of said position. I also created a status row that allowed me to remember to follow up with the positions that I found to be a great fit. By detailing where I applied and application hits, I was able to learn which roles and cover letters/resumes I was getting a high response rate from. 

**III. Know your Story and What you want**

Another pitfall of navigating the labor market is saying and believing you want anything. As much as you believe it to be true, it hinders your ability to network properly and apply to the correct positions. Think about it: how can your network help you and direct you if you have no idea what you want? How can you create a compelling narrative during an interview without having an idea of where and what you’d like to be doing? **I highly recommend you take a week or two off from applying and sit and think about what you’d ideally like to be doing next.** Just ask yourself some questions. Do you want to work in a particular industry? Do you want a particular position regardless of industry? What skills do you have? What skills do you want to build?  Navigating these questions can help cultivate a sense of purpose to your search and make the market seem less overwhelming.

**IV. Resume, Cover Letter, Digital Portfolio, Linkedin** 

A.Resume- You need to make this document air tight AND make it look good. R/Resumes has some great tips and I highly recommend you dish out your resume to friends, family, career services, and any hr or skilled writers you know for some perspective. I sent my resume out to 3 writers, 2 hr managers, r/resumes,  and a graphic designer for feedback. This document is the foundation of your search so why take a chance with a flawed document? In addition to giving your resume some hefty review, I highly recommend you draft several versions with as many bullets/achievements you can think of. I created a master CV that had around 20 bullets per position. This allowed me to quickly pull together unique resumes tailored to each position I was applying for.

B. Cover Letters- There are several school of thought on this document. Some think it’s meaningless; other’s think it can make or break your candidacy. **I personally spent a lot of time perfecting my cover letters**. I started off drafting a completely unique cover letter for every position I applied for. It was time consuming, frustrating, and didn’t always pay dividends but after 2 months I had drafted enough cover letters to have a solid foundation to pull from.  After the first two months, I would draft a unique first paragraph and would often cut and paste previous content from my other letters. This allowed me to churn out more applications towards the end, netting me a higher response rate. 

C. Digital Portfolio- [Imaresume](http://www.reddit.com/r/resumes/comments/1o351d/free_kind_of_awesome_resume_cover_letter_and/) had a great post about creating a portfolio to put on your resume. You don’t need to be a designer to have one of these and I personally think it’s a great asset to show off any work you did in the past.  I used this portfolio to showcase some of my professional and personal writing, advanced excel docs I worked on, and some indesign work I did. I think it adds some flash to your resume and also shows that your a savvy user of the interwebs. 

D. Linkedin- Tremendous resource. Spend some time updating your profile and remember that It shouldn’t be an exact mirror of your resume-more akin to a professional summary. Employers will likely google you and having an industry or position tailored profile can really help set you apart. If you’re unsure of what to put up, just look at people with similar work experience or that work in industries that you’re interested in. You can find limitless great examples.** Linkedin is also a great way to find the hiring manger for a position you’re applying for or if you have any connections to people at the organization**. I have definitely called people in my network for an introduction to someone working at an org I was applying at. It really is a small world.

**V. Follow up** 

Whenever you submit an application, I highly recommend you call the organization you’re applying to and try to speak with someone (unless the posting specifically stated otherwise.) The goal here is to get a hold of the position’s manager and let me be clear: DONT SETTLE FOR HR! You want to build rapport with your potential future manager by simply introducing yourself, saying what you can bring to the job, and if you can send your details directly to him/her. After this, you can write a quick email thanking them for taking some time to chat with you and  simply attach your resume and cover letter. After a few days have passed, I would send a short email (1-3 sentences) just reiterating your interest in the position. Now, I didn’t do this for all my applications-mainly those that I thought were a good fit for my qualifications- but I did notice a slightly higher uptick in my response rate. Point being: If you think the position is a good fit, get on the phone and try to get a hold of the job’s manager. You’d be surprised what a phone call can accomplish. 

**VI. Networking**

The n word. I can’t begin tell you how often I cringed upon hearing its utterance. “Have you explored your network?” “You just need to do some networking.” And on and on. In retrospect, I think my biggest issue was my limited understanding networking. For me, networking was as straight forward as asking some co-workers, former bosses, friends, and others if they knew of any opportunities. And yes, this opened some doors but I was only scratching the surface. In navigating unemployment, I came to realize that one chance meeting or phone call can be just as effective as a full day of bulk applications. So what did i do? I went to meetups and events once a week just to meet people. I would plan events for my friends and co-workers. I would go on linked in and look through my connections contacts, seeing if any of them worked for an industry or company I was interested in. The point being that increasing your exposure, increases your chances.

It's in the field I wanted to get into, however there are so many things that are not normal about this company and I'm thinking about getting out of this insane place sooner than later. 

First off, it's a full time 8-5 job. Smallish company, doing engineering. If we come in at 8:01 am, we literally are not able to clock in - like the system just won't let us. We have to go get in trouble by HR and management for being ""late"" and have to request to change it on our timesheet. 

One of the weirdest things is a bell, just like high school. It goes off throughout the whole building at 8 am, 10 am for a short break, then at lunch at 12, then again at 5 pm when we can leave. It's so bizarre and makes me feel like a child. Also we're not allowed to have any food or drinks out. I had to hide the granola bar I needed to eat because I was starving. And I was so upset I had lunch in my car and noticed so many others did the same. It's so depressing. And the cherry on top was when HR pulled me to the side this morning and told me my fitted black slacks were ""too tight"" and that if the owners saw me they'd be ""very upset"" and that I should try to avoid seeing them today so I don't get in trouble. 

I also feel that covid isn't taken seriously because more than half of the employees don't wear masks even though HR told me in the interview that masks are mandatory. People have been coughing and not wearing masks, and no hand sanitizer is provided anywhere. It makes me so uncomfortable. They do nothing about it. No option for work from home either. 

On top of all this, management treats employees in such an abusive and manipulative way. I've only been here a few days and already feel that I need to get out. It sucks because the actual work that I'm learning and doing is the direction I wanted to go. Idk if it's worth it. I guess I just need to hear it from others that this isn't normal and that I shouldn't feel like I'm letting an opportunity go.

Background: I asked for a salary slightly higher than what I was offered. Big boss said they’d reconsider down the road after they evaluate my performance since I had less experience than what the job posting requested (by a little <1 yr). I’ve been here for 6 mo.

Office culture = most stay late consistently. We are 9-5 (1 hr break but culture is to take a short one or not at all). I’m ok with staying late every now and then when needed but I’d like to leave close to on time. Since I started I’ve been consistently at 9-7 or 7:30 with a ~30 min to just eat, if I even get one.

Concerns:
1. **How do I prove my worth to get that raise while attempting to keep healthy work/life balance?** I’d like to start setting boundaries here. 
2. We are a team of 2 for a large company. We get a decent chunk of work done in 9-7 but even so there are a lot of things that don’t get done when requested because it’s just us 2! Our VP wants us to handle *a lot* of responsibilities and some folks don’t have realistic deadlines. **How do I handle being a small team with a heavy workload while managing expectations and proving my value as an employee?** PS - my other team member doesn’t mind working crazy hours at all so it’s just me.

Fresh out of university, I applied to a bunch of jobs and took the first offer that came my way. As a result, I started working at a major telecommunications company in its market analytics department two and a half weeks ago.

I had started working on Halloween after a few days of unpaid training. I was making $110 a day, and being pressured into being there from 9am to at least 9pm every day (including unpaid Saturdays). It got to the point where the day before I got fired, I got in trouble for asking to leave at 6:30pm because I had to get home to something important, and I had finished all my work for the day.

Worried about how late they could legally keep me, I asked them for a copy of my contract the week after I started working for my personal records. Even though I asked them many times through email and in person over a week, they kept saying that they can't get it for me, and it's not up to them.

They had given us an written assessment a week after I started in the form of a multiple choice survey that said if I scored below an 80%, it could trigger a review and I could get fired due to it. The assessment's study material was a huge binder on company policies, and the assessment itself consisted of remembering specific emails and phone numbers designed in a way where they wanted you to fail so they could fire you without cause.

The day after my assessment, I was frustrated with a project they had given me due to inefficiencies in how they were giving feedback to my team. I raised my concern with my project supervisor and my boss, and even though they seemed understanding, my bosses boss was called in to talk to my team about how the place is supposed to be run.

In hindsight, I guess I got on their bad side for calling them out on their inefficiencies, but I was really good at my job so I didn't think I had anything to worry about. The day I got fired, I wrote a script to automate a portion of the job that would take each analyst up to 6 hours to do, completely going out of my way (missing my lunch) to fix the inefficiencies that I had noticed. I had told them I wrote this program, and would like to make it more efficient if they would give me time to work on it. 

After I had gotten back from my shortened late lunch, I worked on some other stuff and I got called into a conference room. One of my bosses and an HR person sat me down and told me that I had failed my assessment and my ""contract was terminated effective immediately"".  I wasn't even allowed to go to my desk and get my personal belongings, or to say goodbye to the friends I had  made throughout my tenure at the company. 

I'm really upset about this and I just wanted to get it off my chest. Wondering what everyone here thinks I should do.

Edit: Just to clarify. They did give me my stuff back when I got fired, I just wasn't physically allowed to go to the desk and pick it up. One of the HR people picked it up for me.",1542310508.0,2018-11-15 14:35:08

884,My tips on how to use Boolean operations on Indeed to improve your search results.,278,a8b3fj,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a8b3fj/my_tips_on_how_to_use_boolean_operations_on/,22,"After seeing the recent post about how much the Indeed layout sucks (I agree), I thought I could improve your searches a bit by explaining how to use Boolean operations. This is going to mostly be a copy pasta from a comment of mine from a few months ago that was well received and people said was helpful. 

>So you can tell it to include or exclude words or phrases. If you want to exclude the word ""senior"" to filter out senior level positions you would just type -senior. The minus sign here means to exclude the phrase or word. You have to be careful with this though because it removes all results with the word anywhere in the description. You could be filtering out descriptions that say something like ""...reports to senior engineer"" or whatever even if that position itself isn't a senior job. That's what I mean when I say they're a bit too heavy handed.

>But you can remove jobs with only senior in the title by typing in -title:senior. The title designation restricts it to only looking in the job title and not the description. You can do this with phrases too by putting the entire phrase in parentheses like -title:(sales engineer).

>Putting something in quotes means it'll look for that exact phrase or word. It'll only return results that include it. If you wanted something in research and development, you might include ""research and development"". This means the company has to specifically include the phrase ""research and development"" in the posting somewhere though.

>You can filter results only from a single company by using company:XYZ. Throw in a minus sign if you want to exclude results from that company.

>There are also AND and OR operators. AND means the results have to contain everything you say but it doesn't have to be in a specific order like the quotes demand. If you have Word and SQL skills you wanted to utilize you might include ""Microsoft Word"" AND ""SQL"". What about either Word or Google Docs? Use ""Google Docs"" OR ""Microsoft Word"". All of your results will have either one in them.

>Combining all of these together can be extremely powerful if you pick and choose your Booleans and words carefully. You can find very specific listings if you know what you're doing. I've come up with massive strings of Booleans to whittle literally tens of thousands of jobs down to just maybe a couple dozen.

Booleans aren't necessarily exclusive to Indeed.com but I haven't found any other sites that use them but they could be out there. These are seriously 90% of the reason I still use mostly Indeed for my searches. 

Something I've found helpful is just searching for specific company listings on Indeed instead of the company website itself if the company site is shitty, which it often is because they use crap like Taleo or Brassring. ",1545435283.0,2018-12-21 18:34:43

What was your approach?,280,hfqxhz,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/hfqxhz/has_anyone_whos_been_telecommuting_due_to_covid/,84,"Background: Work as a researcher in a university. Since I started, we've occasionally been allowed telecommute, but the big boss in charge of the department has always been resistant to the idea of making it a regular thing. COVID forced his hand. We're still not planning on going back in for a few months, but that decision would get re-evaluated in another month or so. Big boss keeps talking about ""when we go back,"" so it's clear what his preference is. 

&nbsp;

A couple of things are at play big-picture:

We're moving departments and are likely going to be moved from our current offices when regular work resumes and it's not clear where we're going to be located 

We've got pay freezes in place for at least the next year.

Other large departments (IT) are moving to mostly full time telecommute (come in to a shared space once a week if needed) as they are not renewing leases on office space.




&nbsp;

The personal stuff:

I've put out regular work and have increased regular productivity and work quality. The work can be done remotely almost in its entirety. I can make that argument, but some of us in the office have felt that the resistance was always a control issue. 

Everything about WFH has been great so far-- no stressful commute, eating healthier, having time to exercise and sleeping better, able to focus. 
&nbsp;

I've put off really lobbying for it, because I didn't want to seem opportunistic and the way things have been going, it seems like it would settle that way naturally for a while and I want to be careful about how I make the case for it so as to not sour the whole idea. But because the big boss seems to keep wanting to come back personally (he lives a five minute walk from the office, so it's of course not a huge change for him), I'd like to make the final persuasive argument.

I've got so many issues I don't even know where to begin. A very long story short is that I moved to Japan to live with my husband, I had a career in London for the past 10 years but I gave that up as I couldn't get any sort of job in Japan at all as I became stuck in this catch 22 situation where my Japanese level isn't good enough for IT jobs and any other sort of work, even washing dishes figured that I'd leave as soon as I got an IT job and so I've been pretty much unemployed, not really doing a lot for the past 9-10 months or so. I have an online freelance writing job that I do occasionally whenever they give me any work but it's few and far between, that's it. 

If moving 6000 miles away from my home and trying to learn an entirely new different language and culture wasn't enough, I've just had such bad experiences with companies and recruiters that I've come out a bit scarred from the process, for example, having 5 interviews and 3 tests for one company and then being dropped... this kind of thing happened numerous times, being offered internships for people with 5+ years experience... what is this? I don't really have any money at all, the thought of paying for my own transportation and my lunch and having no time... and no income, essentially paying to work for a *bank* just seems insulting and makes me a bit angry that this company is even doing this to be honest. I've also generally been strung along by what seems like every recruiter in Tokyo and those 'work remotely' companies who keep interviewing you for 3+ months, only to be offered a 1099 contract at really low pay - so low that it's not really worth doing and nope, teaching English companies aren't interested in me either. There's been multiple instances of this kind of thing and more that I've forgotten to even mention, I've just become disheartened, downtrodden and depressed. 

It got so bad that I couldn't even speak to any recruiters at one point, I'd just end up in a mess, heck, I'm a bit of a mess just typing this stuff out now. I decided I wouldn't even apply for anything for a while because I needed to just relax and try not to stress about being unemployed, my career dying and generally being a liability in a foreign country. I would only do one thing, my profile is out there and if someone wanted to contact me and talk about something then... alright, I'd speak to them because I feel it'd be rude not to and I'd be doing myself a deliberate disservice if I didn't at least reply. 

That's kinda how I got myself into this mess, lol, I met a supremely optimistic recruiter (they normally ditch me in 5 seconds when I tell them my Japanese isn't very good and that it's a work in progress - I don't have money to go to actual classes so I study at home, whilst my reading/writing are kinda ok, my speaking sucks as well, I've had no practice and my husband is at work all day) and now I've got an interview with a company and I've no idea what to do. 

TLDR: How can I explain my situation, not self-sabotage? (I do this a lot because... depression) and give a good impression? Also my anxiety isn't specifically related to the interview itself, it's more related to speaking Japanese in the interview... something which I don't do very well.",1578597936.0,2020-01-09 14:25:36

891,Review of working remote after 7+ years in an office,280,a0a81h,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a0a81h/review_of_working_remote_after_7_years_in_an/,75,"After a few months now of working fully remote, I'd like to give an overview for those who might be considering it. I will go into a good amount of detail and some personal stuff, so keep that in mind. You mileage may vary.

**Life Working in the Office**

In 2011, I started working downtown in my big city for a health insurance firm. This required me driving 30 minutes to the subway, then 45 minutes ride downtown, then sitting there for another 30 minutes because my boss would go nuts if any of us were late. I'd get up at 5:30am, out the door at 6:30am, arrive by 8am, sit until 8:30am. This is a long commute and I was living with my parents at the time. I'd utilize the time by listening to self-improvement audio/video.

At work, everyone wastes a ton of time. The crew would get coffee either in the break room and bullshit for 30-45 minutes or go out to Dunkin Donuts across the street. I'd hang out with the guys in pharmacy for a bit. Lunch would come and I'd I'd typically eat at my cube a packed lunch and then walk for an hour outside downtown or in the huge garage under the building. However, the work did get done, but not nearly as efficiently as it could be. Overall 4-5 hours of your 8-9 hours was wasted on doing nothing.

The evening commute was always packed. I'd typically have to have to ride the subway the opposite direction a stop or two just to get a seat or sometimes standing room on the way home. 1.5 hours or more in total. At 6pm, I'd be home, workout, then bed. Repeat.

Being in finance, many days were long. I can remember working until 10 or 11pm, being up at 5:30am to do it all again. Once or twice I actually fell asleep in a conference room at 8am after working 5-6 days in a row super late. You tend to get sick a lot more from letting your body run down. You depend on coffee a bit.

Office moral was always rather low, but we got by. Turnover was huge. People would only stay a few months or maybe a year or two. I was the exception at 5 years.

**Life Working Remote**

In 2016, I swapped jobs, still in finance, but real estate. Still going into town, but moved out and living with my SO. Took the bus into town, no more driving to the subway. With this job, we got to work one day a week remote. This was great as you still went downtown, still interacted with people, but you got one low-key day. Typically I did a bit less on my remote days and used it to get laundry in, do dishes, etc. The work still got done and my manager was fine with it all. In fact, he typically left around 2pm to go watch his kids sports games.

He left, I took over the manager role, and out office moved twice. As of a few months ago, myself and my analyst work fully remote, but do offer to drive 30 minutes into the office once every other week.

I've noticed I do not depend on caffeine as much. I get much more sleep. I eat better. I can eat healthier foods for breakfast and lunch. I can get laundry, dishes, cleaning all done. Workouts are done mid-day.  I can pick my SO up at the airport or even get some grocery shopping done mid-day.

As far as workload, I can get much more done and more efficiently. No distractions, lots of focus. Conference calls can be taken and not upset people around me. Even though I have more work to do, it seems to get done so much more quicker. I have time to help make things better or more efficient, instead of just doing the same daily thing.

Employee turnover is near non-existant. Moral is decently high. Most people who do move go internally for career purposes, not because they hate the work or work/life balance.

However, there are some downsides. I used to get 15,000-20,000 steps a day on my Fitbit and now I struggle to get 5,000. You do feel like you're stuck inside a lot. You absolutely have to get up, take a shower, and get moving. If you get up, lay around, or don't get started on something, it can be 11am before you get started, killing your day. You need to be an extra disciplined person and not procrastinate or have to have someone bearing down on you to get things done.

I do somewhat miss going out for coffee with the group or even just going downtown and seeing people and things. I felt like I did make ""work friends"" in the office, even in other departments I could bullshit and rant with. The biggest thing I miss are the lunch walks around town, even in the snow and cold. I do not miss the commute what-so-ever though.

**Conclusion**

Working remote can be a huge advantage. If you have a 1+ hour commute, that's 2 or more hours a day back in your life, which is a big deal. For me it was near 4 hours. The aggravation isn't there either.

If you do work remote, you need to setup some time in the day for exercise or lifting. Get outside somehow if you can. Make sure to keep some close friends and social life going as that part of work will be gone.

Your health should improve as long as you keep decently active. More sleep, better eating, less stress.

The two biggest questions you need to evaluate for yourself is how much social interaction you'll miss from going into a physical location and how well you do working on your own without a boss hovering over you. If you typically interact less or only when you have to, working remote might be a good choice. Also, if you can get your work done and fee accomplished without someone patting you on the back or keeping tabs on you, then remote might be a good fit.

Just my two cents, but hope it helps.",1543194817.0,2018-11-25 20:13:37

The purpose of this folder, and sending copies to myself, is so I have ample ammunition come review or job-hunting time.

We employ Agile and do software/web development and I usually run a team of 8 to 30 people at a time. I like what I do a lot but I've honestly been seeking to work for an actual IT company and not just be apart of an IT department.
    So I have been on the job market for a year and a half. I have been part of multiple interviews locally, this includes lunch interviews, behavior, and just technical. It seems however I just can't seem to catch a break and what's worst it seems most people don't understand what I do. I know for a fact that most recruiters and HR departments have no idea what I do. So of course I'm like OK I'll relocate out of my state. So I've flown out to the west coast and been part of interviews with Twitter and Facebook. The sad truth is I didn't get job for either companies. 

I've recently just flown back from another job interview and yet again I heard they really like me but made the tough decision to say no. I've asked for feedback of course but the feedback doesn't seem genuine or really help. Also take it this is my 5th interview with this specific company. 

So I'm sad of course, I'll get over it eventually but the market is just crazy. It seems I'm either working with people who don't know what I do (even when reviewing my resume) or the competition is just too high.

899,How to keep going after so many rejection letters?,277,e2kqhv,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/e2kqhv/how_to_keep_going_after_so_many_rejection_letters/,200,"Sorry if this sounds incredibly ranty or rambly, but I really could use everybody's two cents here and need to get a few things off my chest honestly.

I've been looking for engineering work since early mid September. I've sent out closer to 230 applications, and had 30 phone interviews and 12 in-person interviews. However, I keep getting those automated rejection emails left and right, sometimes shortly after a phone interview where things seemed to be going well. For example, I had a phone interview late last week with an HVAC company that went well, and then this morning woke up to a big, fat rejection letter.

I'm only 24, and I have a great enthusiasm for my field (engineering) and I'm more than willing to do the hands on work to get a job done right, plus I think on my feet and work well with other people.

I wish I knew what it is exactly I'm doing wrong. What are employers (at least in engineering) looking for? Experience? I have previous full-time experience working for a Fortune 100 firm. Is it references or a portfolio? I've got projects and professional references ready to go.

I'm starting to feel at a total loss and just seeing the endless pile of rejection emails in my inbox over and over is starting to make me question both my future and my life choices as an adult.

The one towered over me and basically said he didn't want to #$%@ see me ever again as he stomped out.  The other told me to take the rest of the day off. What is the protocol? Do I still show up?

It’s like this feeling that you don’t know if you will succeed this week, the dread of all the things left undone because you didn’t have enough time last week, the feeling of whether something will happen and you will lose your job this week.

I don’t know if I’m alone but I feel this almost on a weekly basis. 

Some of it is in my mind, some of it I know is a factor of the company reputation, and finally, some of it is based on stress and being overworked.

I think in this day and age with careers many people work in excess of 50 hours. In my role it is not uncommon to hear people who have been on their laptops well into the night, logging in at 9-10pm after their kids are asleep to do some work. I’ve long refused to do this. I work 50 hours, 10 over my contacted amount, and there is often still a lot more work to do.

In this day and age it seems like resources are scarce, but the work is the same, or even increasing. People are often working longer hours, stressing more, and living in constant doubt.

I know I am. And I don’t know how to combat this. My company is a political and organisational mess. Utter disaster. But it’s a huge company with people who have been in this mess for years. People who have stabbed others in the back. The management style is cut throat. The career advancements sinister.

920,All about the trades: addressing some myths of the trades (specifically Electrician / Plumber / Welder),273,c4qp5d,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/c4qp5d/all_about_the_trades_addressing_some_myths_of_the/,85,"So it has come to my attention that there is a lot of misinformation out there in regards to the trades. Some of it partially true, some of it wacky and outrageous, and some of it flat out wrong. Nearing almost a decade now since I ventured out to be an electrician I thought I'd clear some stuff up to help those interested in picking up a trade as their career.

1.) *You'll make 6 figures as an electrician / plumber / welder!*: You CAN make 6 figures. From 2013-2018 I averaged $140,000 a year after taxes. Here's the caveat to that. I was what we call a road whore. Travelling from construction site to construction site across the U.S. Sharing hotel rooms with 2-3 other guys to pocket most of my per diem ($100-120 a day untaxed), and working 60-70 hours a week. Expect only $10-$14 an hour as an entry level unless you're a traveler. Once you're a Journeyman in your desired field you can reasonably find a job paying a decent $60,000-$80,000 a year without having to travel or work every weekend.

2.) *There must not be a shortage of tradesmen, because I've applied to 10000s of places and still haven't gotten a response*: More than any other career I've encountered, getting your foot in the door in the trades is among the most difficult. But once you're in, you're in. These companies aren't looking for people who just need a job, they're looking for people who will work for them for 20-30 years and are very selective about who they choose for the most part. So in the mean time, work part time at a mom and pop shop, go to a trade school to make yourself stand out, and call every company in your state to find work. When starting out you MUST be willing to relocate and / or travel or you could be waiting for a very long time.

3.) *How dangerous is it?*: I'm not gonna lie, it is one of the more dangerous fields out there. In the U.S., more construction workers have died than soldiers since 9/11. It isn't because of electrocution, crushed bys, explosions, struck bys, cave ins, etc. The #1 killer on job sites is falls, almost half of all deaths. People not wearing their harnesses, climbing on sketchy scaffolding without inspecting first, extension ladders instead of scissor lifts, the list goes on. Take your safety classes seriously, and inspect everything when in regards to a possible fall hazard.

4.) *Every tradesmen I know has a broken body by the time they're 40*: It is taxing work, but it is a lot healthier to be working your body all day than sitting all day. Times have changed a lot since the previous generation. Now wearing personal protective equipment is nearly required on all sites, very rarely do electricians perform live work, silica / dust OSHA laws are enforced pretty well recently. It's all up to you. Wear kneepads despite the jokes about getting a promotion. Do proper stretching every hour. Don't drink like a fish as soon as you get off work like a lot of guys. And most importantly get your 7-8 hours of sleep every night instead of partying like you're still 20.

5.) *Am I too old to join the trades?*: At the large electrical company I work for, about 20-25% of new applicants are guys over 30 with very little knowledge of the trade. If anything I would say you have an advantage in getting hired over a fresh faced 18 year old kid with very little previous work experience. It's never too late to learn. I've seen a man as old as 65 join the trade. Having said that, don't expect to make journeymans wage right off the bat just because you're older. You may get paid a few dollars more for some previous experience over the kid straight outta high school, but it won't be very much.

6.) *Union or non-union?*: It doesn't matter. Both have their pros and cons. Work experience is EVERYTHING until you get your journeymen's license. It's more important than any trade school degree you may have. Rack up as many experience hours as you can at any and every job in your desired field.

7.) *Job security*: It depends. There are two different fields to look at. Construction and service / maintenance. Construction is where you'll make the most money, but they come and go with the economy. The best method is to do construction when it is booming like it is now and then switch to the service side of things when the economy isn't as good. Service / maintenance is more secure with a steady supply of work, with a bit less pay and hours. With any job, try to have a few months worth of paychecks saved up in case of any unforeseen layoff.

8.)*But I'm a woman / am worried about the social aspect in the trades and construction*: Most people in this field are men, and most of them do seem to be conservative. However most of them also tend to keep their politics to themselves lately. Of course with any job, you'll always notice the louder ones. You will hear a lot of swearing, dark jokes, potentially racist / sexist / homophobic remarks, and unless it's a larger company, not much will come out of it if you contact HR. Having said that, the environment is getting a lot better. I see women all the time at job sites now. Of course the guys will talk sexually about them behind their backs, but any kind of sexual harassment or abuse isn't tolerated. I've seen a guy get fired for calling a gay guy a slur.

I have not had any relevant job experience, just work in IT Support call centers where I had absolutely zero ability to influence decisions or create any value for a company whatsoever.

Sadly, ""massive job accomplishments"", ""5 or more years of relevant industry experience"", ""knowledge of a list of languages that would take 10+ years to learn"" and ""willing to work for an hourly wage on a contract basis"" are what appear to be the main requirements for getting an entry-level Software Engineering job in my city in the Midwest US.

I'm terrified of moving, and have no idea where or how to start looking for jobs in other cities.

I have a GitHub, and I can try to post my anonymized resume here if people want me to.

I have applied to hundreds of jobs in the last few years, and have completely and utterly failed to find any employment.

I have only received two interviews with actual companies and zero offers in the last 10 months since I passed a 6-month Data Analytics course and started looking for work again.

In the year or more before that, I had about three interviews with companies, and zero offers.

The rest of my conversations were with recruiting companies that I haven't spoken to since they interviewed me for a job and said ""We will get back to you."" Guess what, they never got back to me.

I feel like my high-functioning Autism is killing any chance I have of getting a job.

I have absolutely no idea how to get to know people professionally without first having a job, and I sure as hell don't have any meaningful network to rely on.

I have literally no idea what the hell people mean when they say ""It's easy, just network with people!"" This is a completely alien concept to me. I am mentally incapable of kissing up to people to try and curry favor with them.

I feel like I'm stuck in a constant system of Catch-22s:

* I can't find a job without first having a job.

* I can't get experience without having experience.

* I can't achieve accomplishments without having accomplishments.

* I can't get a job network without having a job network.

* I can't explain my lack of social skills in interviews by saying I have autism because it would cause people to think I don't have social skills and therefore cannot do the job. That, or it would make an HR rep crap their pants in fear of litigation, causing me to be removed from consideration.

I'm just about at my wit's end, can someone please help me figure out what I need to do to break this never-ending cycle?",1588799300.0,2020-05-06 17:08:20

Career progression is taking on a ‘dog eat dog’ mindset, and with the increase in profits, targets, KPIs, it seems like there is also a ‘win at all costs’ mentality too.

It’s no secret that underemployment is becoming a big problem. And job certainty is also at risk, with mass lay offs, contract work versus permanent roles and a myriad of ways that the corporate world have removed benefits and increased workloads of employees.

I’ve seen people work 60-70 hour weeks regularly (on salaried positions with no overtime) , and get put up as an exemplar of hard work. It baffles my mind, and all that does it make people give up their personal time and life to be more cut throat against their peers, trying to always get the upper hand to push forward with their own path to climbing the corporate ladder.

On the flip side, I’ve engaged with senior leaders, Vice Presidents and the like, and they all seemingly share the same characteristics which is to play company politics, “say” they look after their people but never do, it’s like they have soft exteriors and smile and it just hides a vicious corporate mentality inside.

Back in June, I'd never thought I'd be without a job in October, let alone December... Ha! With every rejection I kept telling myself that anyone with a job has faced rejection (I guess there are exceptions).

Job searching is just fishing for rejections. Being a recent grad, I have very little weight to pull, and I think a lot of it is just luck that someone will take a chance on you. When the rejections come around all at once, it does take some motivation to keep going. Even now, with a full-time offer, the fresh rejections still have a punch. Ultimately, I wish that more people would talk about finding a job after college.

The 'Entry Level' structure (if it ever was) is gone. Everyone needs to wrap their head around this. I get suggestions for administrative roles, and then I have to relay that I dob't have the three years of experience needed. I mean, I don't know how people change careers without going back to school. It seems that one has to pick a lane and stay in it.

So at this point, I'm continuing my search until I'm in the building. However it the offer does provide some solace that I am not unemployable--I fell down that hole earlier in the week. I never thought I'd get an interview for this position, I did, and then I got a little more.

* Paid one month training where I get daily homework. I haven't been paid yet. The homework assignments seem legit but have some typos.
* They have asked me to buy iphones  with my credit card that they immediately reimburse with bank account info that they gave me to pay back my credit card charges. After I buy them, they have me mail the phones to an IT firm that sets up the devices. The first address was Hong Kong (they claim a HK office), then New Jersey.  
* They  asked me to buy first 4 phones, then 6, then another 6. I only bought the first batch, which I was paid for. The last batch is 6, 256g iphones. The extra storage seems suspicious for a company to buy. I doubt companies buy their employees that much storage for a work phone unless there's something I don't know about the job, like lots of videos?
* They don't appear to have a physical office yet.  They list addresses in PA and TN but they don't appear to be there. They have said they're just signing the lease, etc. 
* Not much online about the company. They had a basic website and now it's an ""under construction"" notice. My contact told me thy are relaunching the site.  
* The phone number is a google voice number
* I haven't met anyone in person yet

I keep thinking things are just off due to them being European and just opening a new office.  But why are they having me buy iphones and then mail them? Seems like money laundering or something?

Today I went to an interview for a sales position at a car dealership. 

He liked me and wanted to get the hiring process started, so he hands me the real application where I need to put all my personal information in. As I'm filling it out, I'm curious about how long the whole thing is going to take because I wasn't expecting to get hired on the spot, and he didn't explain what was going on very well. It was all very rushed and it took him about 3 minutes to decide I would be a good fit to sell cars when I have no direct sales experience. I was honestly just confused about what the hell was going on. I wasn't even totally sure I was getting hired or what. So I ask him how long I was going to be there and what all I would be doing that day, because I had other plans. 

He responds, ""Oh, so you're not serious?"" Before I can explain myself, he grabs the application and rips it twice in front of me and walks away without a word.

On top of that, he did this in a large room that had *customers* in it, and I know for sure multiple people witnessed that. I heard a lady sitting next to us say, ""Did you see that? He just ripped his application.""

I was pretty mad, and later I wished I called him out publicly, because fuck it, nothing to lose at that point, and I want all the customers in there to see what kind of people they were doing business with. 

But whatever, bullet dodged. He did me a huge favor. I would have been miserable working under someone like that.

Here's how I did it.",270,2cfcep,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/2cfcep/i_left_my_job_on_july_18_with_no_leads_of_any/,54,"On June 21, I thought I had found the next step on my career path. Literally less than a month later, I quit. I was working 80+ hours a week for not enough money. It was taking a toll on my happiness and my relationship with my girlfriend. 

I didn't know what to do. I had no savings (besides part of my last paycheck and a paycheck that would be small). However, I hustled and here's how I got a job that I feel I'll love with no help from a network, friends or family. 

First off, I treated finding a job like it was a job. I'm sure you've read this before and it's not a joke. From 8 AM to 5 PM, I searched for and applied to jobs. I wrote a specific cover letter for every one of them. Whether it was the cover letters or the website's crazy antics in regards to the information I had to give, it would take around an hour to thoroughly apply for the jobs. So then, I was turning in 8 applications a day, give or take a couple. I feel that every cover letter I sent was epic. On top of this, I still treated my life the same. I woke up at 7 and cooked breakfast. I went to the gym after ""work."" I even went out with friends on the weekends. By the first weekend, I had had a few phone interviews so I felt going out would be fine as I'd hear back from someone. On top of this, I updated my resume to reflect the skillset that I had garnered or expanded upon in my last job. I also killed a lot of the white space on my resume. I don't even have a G.P.A. on it. I feel like a lot of places understand that a G.P.A. isn't really indicative of anything anymore. I had a 3.003 out of school. Not the best and definitely not the best for some careers (so keep that in mind, engineers, IT, etc.) Regardless, I revamped my resume. Reach out to someone if you're not sure. Do not be embarrassed. I would always try to hide my resume from friends or family when I could've used the help. I didn't want them to know how poorly I'd done in college.

Secondly, I found my job on my state's job board. It's a nonprofit that works to help people find jobs. I don't know if EVERY state has these nonprofits, but I just looked up a few in a few major states. Regardless, I'm sure SOME nonprofit in every state focuses on this. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong. Why I think this played a major role, however, is because this essentially (in North Carolina, at least) weeded out all the Vector Marketing (sorry Vector people!) and bullshit jobs. Now, if you're in IT or something like that, this may not be an issue for you. But I know plenty of people who are ""qualified"" for some jobs, will get calls back in 30 minutes of applying, and find out that it's a pyramid scheme or uncomfortably close. Regardless, I had confidence that every job that I applied to was a legitimate organization. This meant that I was spending my time wisely.

So I got a phone interview. People put so much emphasis on the actual, face-to-face interviews (and they should), but the phone interview is a very real thing now. You need to be preparing for the phone interview as you apply. If you get a call from a random number, it's probably time for a phone interview. If you're not ready, I can only imagine how hard it is to get to the actual, first interview. Regardless, I figured it was coming and knocked it out of the park. If you get a call from a random number and it's for a job you applied to, IT MAY BE A PHONE INTERVIEW! If you're not ready, tell them you're busy. Do anything that you can to hold them off. Telling them, ""Sorry, I'm headed to a three hour movie"" while you prepare for the interview is obviously reasonable considering they randomly called you. If it's not for some organizations, you probably don't want to work there anyway. 

So I got called in for a first interview. At this point, I had spent the past TWO DAYS studying the organization and practicing my answers. In these two days, I still treated finding a job like my job, but I didn't apply to any new jobs. I simply prepared for this first interview. By the time I got there, there wasn't a question they could throw at me that I didn't have the perfect answer to. I came here to r/jobs, I searched for first interviews, I searched for first interview questions to ask, etc. I studied my answers and how I would say them--at what speed, how I would use my hands, etc. I also practiced my posture so that I could have a confident posture as I interviewed. During the actual interview, I kept careful notice of things like my hand movement and posture and adjusted them accordingly. I kept good contact with all three individuals who were interviewing me. I threw a bit of my personal traits in (like my humor) and made them laugh multiple times. When I couldn't think of an answer RIGHT off the bat, I took my time. I'd sit there in silence for 10 or 15 seconds and gather my thoughts. Then, I'd knock it out of the park. Those of you who aren't necessarily personable, practice it. Practice it for the sake of the interview. I can only imagine how many people have not gotten jobs despite being very qualified for them simply because they seemed a bit stiff or awkward. 

During this first interview, you obviously want to relate every question they ask back to your previous experience or education. This may not work for computer science or engineering, but in a lot of careers, you are going to be asked the EXACT SAME QUESTIONS that you read whenever you Google what questions you may be asked. I can't quite hone in on how many questions I got, but I would say a good 25% were questions I'd heard plenty of times before and had mastered. I had mastered exactly how I would tie them back to my previous experience. 

I knew I killed the first one. I texted all of my friends and let them know that the job was mine. After my first interview, they told me that I'd hear back from them by the end of the week (my first interview was on Tuesday), and that there would only be a second interview if there was another great candidate. On Wednesday, I awaited my offer. Cocky, I know. But I flat-out murdered that first interview. Nothing on Wednesday. On Thursday, I received a call... They needed me for a second interview. Fuck. I had some real, true competition. I was one of two possible candidates. Did I fret? Did I cry and hope I'd get it? Nope. I went back to the drawing board. 

This time, I researched the second interview. I'd actually never had one despite having four jobs since 18 (I'm 24 now). I read that there was a possibility that it'd be a tour and that they'd want to see how I fit in with the organization. I read that the questions would get a little bit more in depth. So I prepared. I prepared my ass off. By the way, the second interview was at 4 PM, and they called me to ask if I could come in for another one at 12:30 PM. Maybe that's their technique... but on my end, it just seemed like a short amount of time. Regardless, I got ready as much as I could. I got more in depth with my answers, and literally practiced how I would speak to people I met to show how I'd fit in with the organization. I went deeper in my research. I went through the first 20 pages on Google to read anything I could on the organization. I could've done more, I'm sure. I knew names, dates, facts, and figures. I knew their outcomes, their budget, their programs, etc. I was ready when it came down to it. 

I went in and was as personable as I could be. They had someone new there to interview me. I had expected the CEO from my research (and prepared questions and answers for her in particular!) but it wasn't her. Regardless, I had practiced everything so many times it didn't matter. I took a tour of the facilities, asked NEW and more SPECIFIC questions to see if I wanted to work there (that's what they're looking for on a second interview, I'd read), and walked out of there feeling like I'd kill that interview too.

But tomorrow, 9 AM came. And no call. I waited and I waited. It seemed like I waited for an eternity. No call. DON'T let this psyche you out. Sometimes it takes time as I learned today. Well, I guess that's obvious. But I just always think they'll call the person who gets the job right away. Anyway, I got the call. Every time I've gotten a job, actually, the person on the other end extending the job offer to me has always sounded somber like they had some bad news for me. This was no different. But I heard the words. ""We'd like to offer..."" I literally teared up. I had no savings. I had reached out to my friends and family but to no avail. I had to continue to make money immediately. And I succeeded when I had to. It literally made me flat-out cry. 

So what did I do exactly? I listened to all of the advice I'd ever gotten. I read long ass bullshit like this. I internalized all of the advice that I'd ever read. I was confident mainly. I answered every question like I'd already had the job. r/jobs had helped me out more than they knew. They'd taught me so much about interviewing and fine-tuning a cover letter or resume. Thank you so much, r/jobs. You helped me find work that is righteous. I'm working for a nonprofit that helps at-risk women. This is an important goal to me. This was also the first job I'd ever gotten where there was solely one position. Every other job I'd ever gotten, there were multiple positions open for the same job title. This one was special. And all the research I did, including here on r/jobs helped me tremendously. 

Stay hopeful. And I hope this information helps someone as r/jobs has helped me.

I know there's been research that says to avoid social media sites like FB so you stop comparing yourself to others, I don't even use it to be honest. BUT because I'm job searching, I obviously reached out to a few of my peers if they know any jobs so obviously that involves ""catching up"" them knowing I'm failing badly not being able to land a job yet, me knowing what great positions, and what great companies they work for. For my close friends, I'm sincerely happy for them for getting that job, for those that I'm not so close with its even more painful to hear about their great jobs. I know lots of them are just as unqualified or even more unqualified than me for the job but they managed to get their jobs for some reason. Sometimes I just think I must really have bad luck since I have no idea why some of my peers were able to land great jobs but here I am still stuck in no man's land.

To those who mentioned that maybe I have a high strung attitude for thinking that I might be better than my peers -- this isn't the case at all, and I did not mean it like that at all. All I'm saying is that there are obviously people who got great jobs because of their skills/talent, but there are also peers that I noticed who got great jobs even though they lacked certain skills and attitude. The reason why I could judge this is not because I'm being presumptuous BUT because I've worked a lot with these peers ie; group work and I know for sure that some (not all) were lazy, made me do their work, didn't want to work as a team etc. Basically, just the foundation of what you would need to get any job not even a great job some of these peers were lacking, however they still managed to score jobs.

Bad mistake. I got calls from recruiters every day but most of them were for commission-only sales jobs, jobs that hire and fire by the dozen (like insurance), door-to-door sales (mostly [Devil Corp](https://thedevilcorp.wordpress.com/) companies), and MLMs. 

A lot of these people were really deceptive and went by different names (like one Primerica rep who called her company something else). Other people refused to answer direct questions like ""Is this a door-to-door position?""

I had a recruiter find my info on one of these sites. She was from David Lerner Associates and talked my ear off about how much I'd love the company and ""learn so much from David"".

The reason I'm posting is because I came on this sub reddit looking for tips a while back, but didn't really find anything that would help me as much as I needed. So I'd like to share what worked for me in hopes to help others. 

First ask yourself are you a hard worker right now (not in the past)? For me, not working for 18 months made me slow and a bit stupid to be honest. So I worked on it. I treated my boring nothing to do life as a job. I went on a diet, started working out and organized everything I could get my hands on. I needed to get back in the habit of being busy.

Second, get a masterpiece of a resume made. The first thing an employer judges you by is your resume, like it or not. Make it short as possible keep it down to a single page if possible. Employers go through a shit ton of resumes everyday, you need yours to stand out. A way to do that is to make it easy for them to identify and read. 

Third, try to be the first one to respond to a listing. This part is crucial. Every job I have gotten was because I was one of the first ones to respond. I'm surprised people don't mention this more. I checked 4 different online job sites once around 10am and again at 6 pm everyday. (Craigslist, Indeed, Monster, Caljobs). I prefer Craigslist as it doesn't require wasting time doing hour long surveys for every job you apply to.

Forth, If you are looking for any job, like me. Make multiple resumes for each industry. (Kitchen, Retail, Office, etc.) If you don't have experience focus on your ""soft skills"" and any technical skills that may come in handy. 

Fifth, don't give up. I only say this because someone else told me this when I needed it most. And its true, the only one that can truly stop you from getting a job is yourself. You can outsmart your future employers, trust me.

Peace out.

Story: I wrote (under a different account) about 8 months ago that I interviewed for 2 different positions in the same company. Both times, I was rejected after I was in the final three candidates. Both jobs were my ideal dream jobs. I'm a graphic designer and it was with my dream company with the perfect position. 

After the second rejection, I was devastated. I was so angry and saddened after months (11 months) of failed job searching. I'm sure a lot of us know the pain and depression from it. 

In fact, after the second rejection, I decided to quit my job search and attempt to freelance. I couldn't take another rejection. I have been doing freelancing work for 8 months and have been struggling to make ends meet. 

After the second rejection, I took a 2 - 3 days of just sadness and binge eating/Netflix. It was a long interview process and the rejections took me off my feet, both times. 

After my 2-3 days of recovery time, I decided to write a thank you email to the man who interviewed me.  It took **A Lot** to write that email. I was so mad/sad/disheartened; I simply didn't want to even think of that company. 

I mustered up the courage and broke down and wrote an email something along the lines of 

""Thank you for the opportunity to interview for X position.  It's a shame I didn't get the position, but hopefully we'll be able to work together in the future""

Something along those lines. Extremely short, but I had some personal touch to it. 

I wrote that email and didn't hear back. 

.

After 8+ months of free lancing and REALLY struggling to make ends meet, I received a call from the man who interviewed me. The call went something along the lines of 

""hi, it's X; you interviewed with me for position X a long time ago. 
I had to dig up your last email to get your contact information. We actually have a position open (the same one I had interviewed for) and we would like to offer you the job. We've interviewed you, several times *laughs nervously*, and we know you, your work and your abilities. We would like to offer you the job now. We figured we would see if you are available before we begin the interview process.""

I just went in and got my job offer and signed on. 



My point is: send thank you emails. If not to get an opportunity like me, to be in good terms with people in the industry. It literally takes a few seconds and it can go a long way. ",1466730188.0,2016-06-23 21:03:08

So I asked the question, “What is your favorite/least favorite thing about working here?” Someone that would be on my team responded, “I’m not [playing that game] if you get the job, you’ll find out.” Basically after that I was like, “Forget this.”

I slept on the experience but, the next day, emailed the company and told them I was no longer interested as I didn’t think it would be a good culture fit. The individual who would be my manager, who I actually really liked, reached out to me asking to meet for lunch. I was professional but was honest and told her what happened during the interview. She sincerely apologized but still insisted on getting lunch. I agreed.... but what am I walking into here?

I already told her what the person on the team said in response to my question and how I didn’t think it was a great culture fit. What more could we be discussing? Everything was left very professional, so I don’t think there are any hard feelings. I have no idea what may happen and I’d like to be better prepared.

Any advice would be appreciated!",1554071038.0,2019-03-31 18:23:58

I also don't want to seem like a sneak or someone playing dumb because I legit didn't really suspect anything super out of the ordinary for so long.

Your advice, please!",262,a4ora7,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/a4ora7/unemployed_nurse_now_overqualified_for_nonnursing/,94,"Hello, I'm new to the sub, but I'm glad I found it! I will try to keep my post concise. I really appreciate any advice.

&#x200B;

I am 26. I have a bachelor's degree in nursing and have been working full time as an RN for 4 years in various healthcare settings. I am currently unemployed. My previous job was at a large dialysis clinic in one of the worst areas of my city. The clinic was chronically, absurdly understaffed. The patients were literally uncontrollable at times. The clinic lacked leadership and communication from management. Much of the staff just didn't care much anymore, and the ones that did were going crazy trying to pick up the slack and do their best. After just 9 months at this clinic, I developed severe depression and anxiety. I took a 1 month leave of absence and voluntarily attended a 2 week outpatient day program at a local hospital. I quit as soon as my LOA was over. I didn't give them 2 weeks notice. I fully understand the consequences of having done this. I had been actively looking for other jobs for about 3 months when I quit, but did not have a job lined up before quitting. I decided I would rather work an entry level job than continue working at that clinic because my sanity was worth more than my very nice paychecks.

&#x200B;

Fast forward 2 months, and I am finding that I am not even being considered for non-nursing jobs, most likely because I am overqualified (according to my dad). What complicates things is that I am pretty burned out with nursing altogether. At this time, I am really not interested in direct patient care. I have applied to the very few jobs in my area that don't involve patient care, such as insurance company nurse jobs, but none have worked out, even though my multiple interviews went well. I look often for these types of jobs, but they are very few and far between. I just feel I need a break from nursing for a while to regain my confidence and resiliency.

&#x200B;

When at my previous job, my boyfriend was making about half of what I made, so I paid the majority of the household bills and rent. We don't have enough income to pay our bills with just his income. My parents have gifted us a good amount of money over the past 2 months to help us, and I know they would continue to if needed. Obviously that's not what I want though. I want a full time job. I have done the math, and to pay our bills without help, I would need to make somewhere around $15/hour.  When you narrow the search down, there are really very few jobs in my area that pay close to this, are full time, are something I can physically do, and don't require a specific certification or education.

&#x200B;

I have unsuccessfully applied for about 5 overnight bakery jobs (no experience required), watch battery technician, entry level furniture refinisher, medical equipment warehouse technician, inventory lead at a local candy store, entry level dental lab technician, entry level insurance claims processor.

&#x200B;

I'm just at a loss of what to do anymore.

Should I apply to jobs I know pay too little and try to work overtime? Any suggestions for companies that will not disqualify me for being overqualified?

&#x200B;

TL;DR

Unemployed burnt out nurse, overqualified for non-nursing jobs. Where should I look?

I was diagnosed with autism at 17 but I never view myself as autistic and never went to learn more about the condition. 

Since I was 13 years old, my goal in life was to get a job (and date but that's another subject). I never knew how people got a job though and so I recreated it. Anything and everything was like a job to me. School, boy scouts, church (I am non-religious but damn I learned every single thing in these classes because they gave out real-valued items that I sold for $100+ dollars, all hail the all mighty dollar), lemonade stands, video games, eating well and exercising. 

In fact, the main struggle is that, unlike school or the vast majority of hobbies/activities (even video games), I was never forced to get a job. And so I got carried away in my little bubble world of pseudo-jobs. In fact, I honestly do not believe I have been ""unemployed"" in a sense that all my philosophy regarding any activity was the economics of the situations. Food economics (higher calorie meals tend to give a biased dopamine reaction), game economics (played Eve Online and learned many things regarding human behavior), and the economics of churches providing free donuts (going back to the food bias), and school economics (the grade bias).  

That continued until I turned 30 and I have still never had a job. Most of my time has been spent being in limbo of inaction and playing video games. I have sold most of my video games however so I just watch YouTube videos for the most part. The sea of the internet has an infinite quality that gets overwhelming. 

 I still live with my parents, have no friends, never had a relationship, no college degree, and cannot drive a car.

Because the first step always seemed to be something forced onto me and then I would take up responsibility for it. I was an AP honors student. I had an unweighted highschool GPA of 3.9 (it was the hardest thing ever). I did 5 years of college and had a GPA of 3.8. I studied constantly because I could not read well and had to re-re-re-read things. I couldn't tell you why I was doing school except that deep down I felt it was my job, the why didn't really matter, and I need to take responsibility for the current situation. I never did any executive long-term planning for a career because I felt like, action wise, I was already having a job. 

I did not graduate college because my failed long-term planning led to an identity crisis and created a nervous breakdown. 

So how do you get over your own self-limiting behaviors?",1586711391.0,2020-04-12 13:09:51

I'm just glad I can finally do something in my field, don't have to do customer service anymore and can dress casually for work to boot. Other than the fact that my commute drains me (I'll be moving closer to work in a few months, though) I'm glad I ended up here.

But now that I'm ""corporate,"" I was just thinking about the ways work still feels like a dated convention and needs to come into the modern world a bit more. For example, two jobs ago, I worked at a company where we had a very small amount of walk-in traffic from the public. But yet, business casual was the norm--even to the point that even our IT guy had to wear a dress shirt and tie every day. Jeans were only allowed once a month or on other designated ""charity"" days. This was not a financial services or law business, either. And I didn't make a lot of money but I was still expected to shell out for a nice work wardrobe. It was more understandable to never be able to wear jeans at the law firm I worked at (especially as I was the receptionist), but it still sucked knowing so much of my pay had to go to decent clothes and shoes. And I didn't make a lot at that job either. 

At my job now, even though we are not customer facing, there are two schedules you can have in my department: Time A to Time B or Time X to Time Y. Work from home is only allowed once a week and any more than that you have to have approval. There's even a suggested schedule for breaks and lunch. In a non-customer facing job, I wish more companies would allow for core hours, times you had to be available, and then let employees pick and choose their schedules as long as they work the core hours. I read about that concept on Ask a Manager a lot and you'd think it's very common, but I can never find a workplace like this. It all seems to be ""this is the schedule"" with very little wiggle room. But maybe that's just my region? We're 10-20 years behind everyone else it seems sometimes... 

I also wish that more businesses like banks that have only daytime hours should be open into the evening. Too many people have day jobs these days for banks and doctor's offices to close up at 4:30 or 5 p.m. Of course, I'm not saying that places like this should be open until 10 or 11 at night.  But why not 7:00 or 8? I think it's just a bit silly that work schedules are still so rigid that most of us are only free on Saturday mornings or afternoons. Honestly, if I could change anything about the work world, full time would be 30-35 hours a week to give people time to take care of some of these errands and overall make employees somewhat happier. If I could change my company, I'd allow telecommuting twice a week. That's still three days, the majority of the week, at the office!

​

Current Position: Mechanical Engineer

Current Salary: 90K (underpaid)

New Position: Technical Program Manager (Junior)

Company's 1st Offer: 115K base + 5K one time bonus

My Counter Offer: 130K

Company's 2nd offer: 126K base

​

# Resume

First thing that recruiter sees. Make sure your resume is awesome. You should read your resume and you should go... ""WOW! This guy is awesome!"".

*TIP 1: DON'T BE MODEST IN YOUR RESUME*

Reflect... dig deep and find out how you have contributed to the company... don't look at only your direct contributions... look at indirect contributions as well... If you gave an idea and it helped grow the business, find out how and how much it helped... even if its an estimate, that's ok... But you should be able to stand by it!... Don't bluff (obviously), but also don't undersell yourself. This takes time and you will probably go through a hundred iterations before you it right.

*TIP 2: MODIFY YOUR RESUME FOR EACH POSITION*

Use key words directly from the position description in your resume...

​

# Phone Interview

*TIP 3: DON'T PICK UP THE PHONE (when the call is not scheduled)*

What I mean by that is, if you get a phone call from the recruiter that you are not prepared for let it go to voicemail. If you pick up and they want to dig in to your resume and do a phone screen right then... say ""This is not a good time... Can we reschedule this for an hour/ a day from now?"". Take the time to PREPARE and PRACTICE. Do all the things the websites tell you... Sit up straight, dress well, smile while you talk... but most importantly PRACTICE PRACTICE PRACTICE... Go over your resume... don't just read it to the recruiter but tell it like a story... Write the whole script down... Write down all possible questions and their answers... And PRACTICE...

​

# Interview

Congratulations... if you got the interview you are 80% closer to getting the job... but be prepared to work even harder now...

After my interview I know I did very well and they liked me. That is why they offered me the role! The role was open for a month before I applied... I prepared HARD for a week. There are tons of resources online now to know what kind of interview questions you may be asked... The more you prepare the more confident you will be... Write down answers to the most common behavioral questions... If you are early in your career you may not have dealt with many situations... so make up answers for those situational based questions...

Again... WRITE the questions and answers... and PRACTICE...

Read about the company... knowing more will boost your confidence... and help you decide whether you want to work for them.

Read about the products... especially the one you will be working on...

Read about the people on linkedin who will interview you... if you don't know who they are... ask whoever is scheduling the interview...

*TIP 4: MORE PREPARATION, MORE CONFIDENCE, BETTER INTERVIEW*

​

# Don't give a number

*TIP 5: NO MATTER WHAT, DON'T BE FIRST TO GIVE A NUMBER*

""I would first like to see if I am a good fit for the position before we discuss compensation""

""I am sure the company has budgeted something for this position. Would you be able to share that information?""

""Where you value this position is a critical piece of information for me to evaluate this opportunity. Would you be able to share that information?""

""I'm sorry I don't feel comfortable sharing my salary information with you""

""I would really appreciate if we can first talk about how I fit into this role. I would like to find out more about the role and the team""

Do your research, know how much you should be paid before you discuss any numbers and try your best to not give a number first. It will get awkward, but you will get past it!

​

# Offer

I was super confident coming out of the interview that I will get an offer... Partly because I had prepared my ass off for the week before and secondly because they said they loved my resume... A day later I get an offer...

*TIP 6: IF YOU GET AN OFFER, THAT MEANS THEY LIKED YOU & YOUR INTERVIEW WENT WELL. DON'T DOUBT YOURSELF.*

Now the offer I got was 28% higher than what I currently made. I should be thrilled and accept it right away right?!?!

Well, I knew I could get higher based on my qualifications and market value. I was thrilled and jumping inside to have received the offer but I didn't show that. I said ""I am very happy that the team found me to be a great fit. If you can send me the offer letter, I can evaluate the overall compensation and get back to you""

Find out when to get back, what all the other factors (vacation, sick days, 401K match, etc) are and how they factor in. There are online calculators articles, [salary.com](https://salary.com), [payscale.com](https://payscale.com) tons of other sites that will help you. Go to all that you can find.

*TIP 7: DON'T THINK ABOUT YOUR PREVIOUS SALARY WHEN EVALUATING YOUR NEW SALARY*

​

# My Counter

*TIP 8: NEVER ACCEPT FIRST OFFER*

Go back and give them a counter offer. Prepare Prepare Prepare. Watch this video:

How to Negotiate Your Salary, with Ramit Sethi - YouTube

Know what they liked.

"" Well first and foremost I want to say I really appreciate the offer and I am very excited about this role. This is the job that I want, and it aligns well with how I envision my career progression. That being said, the experience that I bring to the table and the value I’ve been able to demonstrate in my prior roles warrants a much higher salary than xxx""

"" Based on my research, what I have found is that a similar role in this area has a base salary in xxx to xxx range, with another xxx to xxx compensation in annual bonus, equity or other forms.""

Recruiter: We have no budget!

"" Well I understand that there may be budgetary restrictions, but I would really look at this as an investment. During my interview, we had discussed my success in my previous roles and the significant contributions I was able to make (give examples). I believe the interview panel would be in agreement when I say that with my skill mix and experience, I will be able to replicate that success in this role.""

Recruiter: We have to keep in mind what we pay others!

"" I understand that. But again, given my experience and the what similar roles pay in this industry and area, I believe my expectations are fair. I am extremely excited about this role and my skills and experiences align well with what this position demands.""

*TIP 9: IF YOU WANT XXX, COUNTER WITH AT LEAST XXX + 10%.*

​

# Offer # 2

Have 3 numbers -

a. Your Ideal Salary (highest, dream salary)... for me this was 140K

b. What you think is fair... for me 123K

c. Lowest you will accept... for me 115K

If offer # 2 is between a and b, well you nailed the negotiation!

If it is between c and b, either rinse and repeat, or suck it up and accept.

This landed me up with an offer 40% higher than my previous salary and 12% higher from their first offer.",1535077858.0,2018-08-23 22:30:58

I've never asked anybody how much they make. I've always thought that's a rude question. Unless we're married or I'm applying for a loan from you, it's none of your business. 

Last time I had phone screener, I countered the question by asking what the salary range was. She wouldn't answer. Another time, I revealed my salary and she said the company could hire me ""at a bargain."" What the fuck? She basically admitted that they wouldn't pay me market value. 

Why is it accepted for recruiters to ask for your current salary? What ways are there of avoiding the question without coming off as rude?",1462584205.0,2016-05-06 21:23:25

983,I've been a year-round temporary employee for 3 years. I'm discouraged and exhausted.,255,efjb09,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/efjb09/ive_been_a_yearround_temporary_employee_for_3/,63,"Hi all.

I started my job in summer of 2016. When I was hired, I understood my position was a seasonal, temporary position not to exceed a certain number of hours per year. At the end of the ""season"", I was asked if I wanted to stay. I said yes.

I have now been at my workplace (local government) for 3 years as a ""seasonal, temporary employee"". I work year-round, anywhere between 25-40 hours a week depending on need (since I am not a full-time employee, my hours are not guaranteed and I once had my hours slashed in half because I was close to meeting my yearly limit).

My responsibilities have increased **dramatically** since I first started. I now do the same work (and sometimes more) as certain full-time employees. I help train new employees and have had a significant role in developing workplace procedures. I've taken on major workloads when other employees have had to go on leave for several months and led projects while they were away. I've obtained several certificates on my own time that I thought would make me a more valuable employee.

My direct supervisor has approached higher-ups numerous times on my behalf. My supervisor has succeeded in getting me a promotion (which was really just a title change and slight raise of \~$1; I had already been doing all the duties in that position for quite some time) getting me a raise (\~$2 more than my starting hourly pay/\~$1 more than my previous raise), and appealing to our division chief so work would pay for a training and a conference I attended. I am so grateful for the steps my supervisor has taken, but I don't anticipate many more improvements in the future.

I love this job. I am surrounded by wonderful people who share my passion for the work we do. I feel like I am making a difference in my community and have learned so much on the job. I can honestly say that I look forward to going to work every day. But I can't keep doing this.

I don't receive benefits. My hours fluctuate and my income is so low and variable that I am unable to find housing (I have to live at home). I am discouraged, exhausted, and feel like there's no potential for growth. I've started looking at jobs elsewhere, but my field doesn't have many positions to offer. I hate that I'm going to have to leave my workplace, but this isn't sustainable anymore. I feel like I'm being taken advantage of.

Have any of you been in my shoes? Were you able to get a permanent position in your workplace? Did you leave and find something better?",1577324523.0,2019-12-25 20:42:03

* Most entry positions ask for recent graduates, do I stand a chance if I apply to those positions?

- 'I don't get on with my colleagues and/ or manager'

This answer would indicate I don't get on with people, and might not get on with my new colleagues.

- 'My current job is understaffed and we are all stretched too thin there, and the workload is unmanageable'

 > Dear Alicia,

 > I am unsatisfied with your online assessment. I find rotating shapes in my head and answering a multiple choice question, 40 times in 15 minutes is irrelevant to this job position.

 > If you would like to start a professional relationship with an interview you may call me. Thanks. 

I understand jumping through hoops to advance your career, but the hoops I imagine are things like a professional exam, a professional license, board exams. 

To ask me to take an online assessment that is irrelevant to the job position isn't asking me to jump through hoops. It is going too far. It is asking me to check my self-respect at the door.

I encourage others to recognize their self worth and if you're too good to spend your time either: 

 1. completing a task, for free
 2. taking an online assessment, that takes too much time
 3. working for free, for free

Then don't. They can **pay you for your time**. 

How a company hires people, says a lot about how they will treat you as an employee. Are you a job-begger? Beggers can't be choosers. 

Anticipating the comments I'm going to get: 

 1. I'm going to start my own company, yes soon, I have my DBA and now I have to figure out the Articles of Incorporation and Tax ID. I'm reading all the legal documents so it's taking time. 
 2. I am not entitled. I'm not saying, ""I should be entitled to this job."" I am demanding respect. If you're wasting my time you're disrespecting me.

I'm a mid 20s female working in engineering.  This winter I was approached by management and was asked if I could take over for my boss when she's on her maternity leave.  I accepted and have been in the role for about a month (until June when she returns).

About a month after they asked if I could take over for her, they informed me that due to budget reasons my original position would be removed and I would be laid off in July after my boss returns.  They encouraged me to start looking for other jobs but implored me to ""stay until she returns in July"" because they need me to cover for her.

Well, because I have bills to pay, I started applying for jobs and actually received an offer fairly quickly.  The new job (at a great company that will pay me much more than what I'm making now) wants me to start ASAP, preferably in late May or early June, which is before my boss returns.

I'm terrified to tell management that I want to leave before she comes back because they asked me to stay through July so many times.  But on the other hand, I find it incredibly disrespectful that they feel like they can tell me I'm getting laid off but essentially just want to use me through her maternity leave and then get rid of me.  My gut (and family and friends) are telling me to just tell them straight up that I have to do what's best for me and that I can't sacrifice a career that quite frankly, my managers told me to look for in the first place.
