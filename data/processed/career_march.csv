In America, and possible other countries that use American English, the word is spelled 'License'; in Canada and the UK, it is not. 

On my resume I have a section near the end that lists a few licences and certifications I have. The interview was for a very large engineering company that gave me the interview after a recommendation I received, so I assume they only glanced at the resume before giving me a call.

The interview itself was supposed to be an hour, but it only lasted around 45 minutes. I was being interviewed by a man, Joe, and a woman, Jane. Near the beginning of the interview Joe points something out on my resume to Jane and smirks, I knew the area of my resume he was looking at and assumed it was to do with a cert I have that doesn't formally expire so the formatting is weird.

The interview went really well, but it all fell apart at the end when we were wrapping up, Joe said ""just one last question, how do you not proofread a resume?"". He followed it up with a comment about how it otherwise looked great and I obviously put time into it, but this typo was jarring. I asked what typo and he just pointed at 'Licence'; my reaction was shock and a stunned silence before I said ""that's how you spell that"". Which he didn't like. He chuckled at my comment and sounded really annoyed when he just spat out that no, it wasn't. I didn't know what to say so I doubled down and he got very annoyed / angry and became pretty condescending. He started lecturing me about how he was trying to help me, how I obviously wouldn't be getting this job but in the future I should just focus on my spelling and not to attack interviewers. We started to argue and bicker over it and it was getting heated when he told me to leave. I said check your drivers licence and tell me how it's spelled there but he wouldn't. He just ended the interview on that note. While I packed my things and put my coat on, Jane checked, and told Joe that it's spelled licence there. I had already mentioned that 'License' is the american english way, but he didn't seem to know what i meant.

How should I handle that in the future, or should i just take the word of my resume?",1584490749.0,2020-03-17 20:19:09,March

Some of us were part of a major company initiative, and there is a strong since of camaraderie amongst those who were part of it and are still with the company. As a result of my strong work performance and the respect I share with my peers, my boss pegged me as the ""point person"" for my department - which involves setting guidelines and training new employees within my wing of the operation.

*You can imagine their surprise when I put in my two-week notice a few days ago.*

Despite the good vibes mentioned earlier, I had not received a raise or promotion since I started. I met with my boss and supervisor several times, and was told the earliest they could promote me or give me a raise was in 6-7 months from now. I recently took an interview with another company, and offered the promotion and raise I was looking for. I accepted it because it's what's best for my career.

Since my boss and my direct supervisor were both out of the office on the day I received the offer and my start date with the new company is soon, I e-mailed them a professional note announcing my resignation effective in two weeks and thanking them for their support during my time with them. My coworkers' reaction upon finding out from my boss and supervisor have been all over the map.

My supervisor, who I shared a good relationship with, didn't talk to me for three days. When he finally met with me behind closed doors, he berated me for leaving - though also asked if there is any counteroffer the company could make after saying I 'burned a bridge' with him, which was sort of a weird 180. A couple of other coworkers who are part of the ""camaraderie"" still haven't spoken to me. My boss, though he understands my decision, was not shy about mentioning the staffing woes the department is now in (we were understaffed even before I put in notice). On the contrary, one superior  who I thought would be indifferent has become my biggest supporter, wishing me the best and saying the company played itself by not promoting me when they should have.

Work in sales and  have done for just shy of a year, before that I was in a financial  brokerage for a year, and an investment bank for a year. Graduated in Business Management in the UK, on a 4 year with a placement.

The  thing is and this has been the case for all my life and probably is for  many - there's just not something I am so passionate about that I want  to invest all my time specialising in. I left finance because I actually  hated the environment, the people. It was so toxic at one point I  resigned from my brokerage and luckily landed a job in tech sales. It's  now been just shy of a year and there's always so much pressure with  targets and aside from COVID for one moment, your job is under threat  after a period of time if you don't keep up with the numbers.

As  I approach 30, I have come to realise that life ISN'T worth this kind  of stress. And yet I'm earning £50k GBP which is in terms of averages,  pretty decent going for a 29 year old. But it's somehow not important to  me. If anything, it's easy to compare to some of my younger friends who  are in banking and earn even more than that and will continue to earn  more and more. I find myself looking up and thinking I should be doing  better, rather than looking down at say retail workers who earn 20k for  example. Heck, I'm talking to a Brazilian lady on a dating app who is 35  and works in a retail store as well as a restaurant receptionist - I  suddenly look much better than her. It's easy to forget.

But  I think I would be happier if you told me that I found my  girlfriend/wife to be, and was earning 20k, rather than earning say 50k  as I am and being single. There's just nothing that makes me think life  is worth repeating day in day out just to pay a mortgage, retire, and  then die. It just feels so unimportant. I guess I was never lucky enough  to discover my 'passion' from a young age and implement it into my  work. I'm into football but don't want any job around that other than be  a professional football player, which I am not.

I  recently started to look into coding and weigh up whether this would be  worth my time. It's actually interesting, but reading between the lines  it seems that it's going to be very challenging finding work in this  area without a degree, notto mention take years to learn enough to be  job ready.

I just feel kind of  lost and always have done with 'work'. Like there's never been an  underlying purpose/motivation behind it. Anyone else having career blues  around a similar age?",1585538377.0,2020-03-29 23:19:37,March

Am I missing something? Nothing really calls to me for a job, so is this it? Do I just bartend so that I have something to make an income off of for the rest of my life and just kinda die inside?

So our company is quite small - growing moderately - and without sounding big headed, I have helped the company grow a lot. I know they really need me and my skills as a designer, however my manager takes most of the credit of my work, therefore he is getting promoted more than me (I also get the fact he is the manager) and instead I have received a small salary increase instead.

Anyways, the manager treats me like crap most of the time, our boss can also be horrible and demands the best quality of work with the shortest amount of time possible (so working OT/working over weekends) and if you don't deliver, you're just not good enough for their company. My manager has honestly been horrible to me, even the staff in different departments commented on how he speaks to me.

My notice period is a month, and I know for a fact he's going to be so horrible when I tell him I will be moving to a different company (sort of a competitor too), and I'm just not willing to sit through for a month of hell. He's currently been nice because one of our ex assistant had left a horrible glassdoor review of working for the company.

What should I do? Should I lie that I'm leaving the city to go back home? I know he will be constantly asking and prying for the rest of my notice period so I can't exactly say 'I can't tell you/I don't need to tell you'.

Help/advice will be appreciated!

I’m wondering if she’s really trying to be helpful or if she’s campaigning for a supervisor position. We are on the same team & have the same job title. Also worth noting, I have been doing this job for 3 years, she has been with the company for a couple years but is new to this role. She is also at least 30 years older than me.

Today she sent an email to myself, my manager, and a couple of other coworkers that I work closely with. It included a list of “best practices” when onboarding our clients and said she was excited to teach me how to do so. Again, this is a job I’ve been doing for 3 years and have never received a complaint about my quality of work. The kicker about this email is that she also felt the need to copy and paste our job description into it.  I spoke with a coworker that was also on the email to see if I had missed something and to find out why this email was even sent, and that coworker confirmed that I have not had any missteps in these areas so the email seems very out of the blue. 

There have also been a couple of instances where she checks in to make sure I’ve done things on my accounts that she is not involved in. Every time she asks these questions the answer is yes, I have done it, but she continues to go out of her way to make sure I’m doing my job.  It’s out of character for members of our team to check that other teammates are completing work properly, (whether that’s right or wrong for our organization I’m unsure) I can’t imagine ever doing this to another member of my team. It feels like she’s stepping on my toes but I don’t want to seem ungrateful if she truly is trying to help.

I am a 25-year-old college grad, trying to pursue a career in marketing/ media. However, due to a series of setbacks (some of them my fault, others not so much), my resume is terrible. It's basically a collection of short-term jobs, all of which have had really terrible endings...which is also an issue because it makes me uncomfortable using references. My work history is riddled with gaps, as well.

I feel like I'm in a hole, and don't know how to get my career back on track. I have so many resume gaps, and haven't even had one job for an entire year yet. I really want to start working on my professional goals, but feel as though a couple wrong moves that I made immediately after graduating have set the tone for my career moving forward- and it's very far from the one I wanted.

***Please note:*** *While grad school would be a good solution, I cannot afford it and even if I could, I've missed the deadlines for several schools with ""mandatory summer starts""; meaning I'd have to wait until summer 2021 to start, which isn't an option.*

Here is a **timeline of my professional life since graduation**.

**Background:** 

\-Graduated in 2017 with a major in Media Studies (focused in Advertising) and minors in both Marketing and Creative Writing. 

\-Had a few great internship opportunities, while still in school- one with a major media company (wound up not working out because I lived in Virginia and couldn't get to Los Angeles in the time span they gave me), and the other was a remote internship with a large online magazine, which I completed.

\-Graduated with honors, 3.3 Cumulative GPA and 3.6 Major GPA.

\-Was in long-term relationship (nearly 5 years) with guy whose graduation was pushed back a year, due to changing majors- meaning, he was staying in the college town and I would be too, seeing as we'd been living together for years.

**Timeline:**

***May 2017-*** Graduated

***Summer 2017-*** Worked at marketing internship w/ large restaurant chain in college town, in order to stay with boyfriend. 

***Fall 2017-*** Took a call center job, in order to make money while job hunting. Still doing this to stay with boyfriend. *Stupid decision.*

***December 2017-*** Could not find job. Got cheated on. Wound up quitting call center job, breaking up with boyfriend, and moving back in with parents.

***Winter 2018-*** Applied for full-time jobs, while working as a ""temp"" secretary (with some unofficial marketing work) at a real estate company, through a staffing agency.

***Spring 2018-*** Could not find a full-time marketing job, with so little experience. Was offered a full-time job with Real Estate company, a.k.a. ""buyout"" from staffing agency, so I would be an official employee, not a temp. Promised marketing/social media responsibilities. Decided to pursue this. Even submitted application and deposit for company-owned apartment next to office.

***May 2018-*** One manager turned out to be mentally unhinged. Stole my $250 deposit for the apartment, stole my SSN, and more. Upper management knew she had done this for days before reporting it to me. (Long story). I quit the job.

***June 2018-*** Got together with new boyfriend. Applied for marketing jobs, but was unsuccessful. Temp agency stopped working with me because I had called the authorities on my former employer for stealing from me. Basically said that their business w/ the company was more important than me.

***July 2018-*** Boyfriend got job with large tech company in Silicon Valley. I had always wanted to go to California and so had he, so we decided to take a leap of faith and go, despite me not having a job lined up. Stupid decision.

***August 2018-*** Moved to Cali. Had been applying and still was. No responses.

***Fall 2018-*** Job hunt unsuccessful. Even fast food places weren't hiring. Too many people, not enough jobs. Did not have a car, which lowered the radius I could travel and hurt my chances further. Went into crushing debt.

***Winter 2018-*** Went home alone for a month or so, to get my finances back under control. Applied for jobs.

***January 2019-*** Received job offer from startup in Silicon Valley. Accepted offer and returned to boyfriend in California.

***Winter/Spring 2019-*** Worked my a\*\* off for company, barely making anything ($20/hr in San Fran- no time and a half for overtime, which happened a lot). Started to notice some shifty things about them- paying me through Venmo-like app, no incoming revenue, etc. 

***May 2019-*** Found out from people ""working for us"" that they were being tricked into free labor. Tried to talk to employer to fix this and make company legitimate, but was shut down. Started applying for other jobs.

***Early July 2019-*** Startup tanking. People quitting left and right. Mental health rapidly declining. Received offer for a job a few states away, so I quit and moved with my boyfriend.

***Late July 2019-*** Got to new city after a long road trip. Called new employer to verify address and start time for first day that Monday. Found out that they had decided to hire an internal candidate at the last minute, and I was never informed. At this point, I'm in a new city and I'm homeless and unemployed.

***August 2019-*** Started working with local temp agency. Got good Marketing gig. Pay was low, but it was work. The contract was for one month, but they were planning on hiring me full-time after it ran out. Even had me write out a list of things I needed for the Marketing department for upcoming year, in order to get them approved during budget meetings. They were approved.

***September 2019-*** Received a phone call on one month anniversary of starting job. It was the temp agency. They said the company couldn't afford to hire me, so they were taking me off the position immediately and would find something else for me. I was devastated, but had no say. Contract said company couldn't work directly with me for a year after contract ended.

***Fall 2019-*** Temp agency could not find anything and basically ghosted. Unemployed, except for an odd job here or there. Broke. Crippling debt getting worse. Applying for jobs every day. Unsuccessful. Every marketing company that contacted me back was one of those MLM scam agencies, posing as legit businesses. 

***November 2019-*** Went home again for financial and health reasons. Kept applying for jobs.

***December 2019-*** Had a few interviews, but got turned down for a few things due to being home for the holidays. Finally got an offer for a phone sales role. I had little interest, but needed the income.

***March 2020-*** Have been working at new job since early January 2020. Pay is low. Hours are long. Metrics are unreasonable, and valued over actual productivity. Forced overtime with no pay. Employer won't even let us work from home during Coronavirus outbreak- despite having the tech to do so and confirmed/suspected cases among employees. I need to find a new job to transition into, once quarantine is over. 

&#x200B;

**So, here I am.** In the past, I've been told by hiring managers that my short-term assignments, lack of updated references, and resume gaps are red flags. I get that 100%. However, ever since graduating, I've been applying to crazy amounts of jobs each year and have been getting turned down due to lack of experience for 95% of those. Meanwhile, the jobs that have interviewed/ hired me have unfortunately been so easy to get a job with, or so it would appear, because they're not good companies to work for.

I am so set back in my life right now, all while desperately trying to get out of debt, get legal help for the cases that require it, and get my career started. I'm so depressed having to pay my student loans each month, despite not having worked one day in a full-time, salaried marketing role since finishing school.

&#x200B;

**What can I do (other than go to grad school), to get my career back on track?**

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** Since graduation, I haven't been able to secure a good job due to lack of experience. The companies that have hired me have been terrible to work for, resulting in short employment periods, a lack of recent references, and lots of resume gaps. This is affecting my ability to get a good job in my field and I don't know how to turn things around. Please help.",1584434201.0,2020-03-17 04:36:41,March

Without getting into too much detail, I've had a problem throughout my entire life which had disallowed me from participating effectively in any kind of institutional setting. I would summarize the problem by saying that I can't deal with ambiguity. In school, I would sometimes not turn in work that I had already done because I wasn't exactly sure where or how to turn it in, and I was too afraid to ask. That's an extreme case, but I had lots of other smaller issues like that. Not sure of how to do some kind of project that they provided little to no information on the specifics of. I'm sure people can relate, but the difference between you and me is that you seem to be able to bs your way through it and find some way to figure out what they're trying to ask you to do.

I was homeschooled for a lot of my life, and my problems with ambiguous instructions began in 4th grade where I attended a public school for the first time. I also have pretty bad social anxiety and I generally lack common sense in a lot of areas, leading to various other problems functioning. I would go into more detail but it seems unnecessary for now. The basic point I'm trying to make is that I can't deal with normal institutional scenarios. I'm pretty intelligent and pretty talented in some areas, but when an obligation presents itself in the form of an institution, that's when I can't deal with it. I don't want to deal with it but I also can't. Somehow, when a bunch of bureaucrats or a bunch of profiteers get involved in some sort of activity, they turn the activity itself into a secondary goal. The main goal is to fulfill the bureaucracy's requirements, or to suck up to the right people, or to help your boss make profit. No one wants me to do some task for the sake of simply doing the task, and I think the spirit of that situation is just very difficult for me to function in, and the ambiguous instructions that come up in that situation are just the cherry on top, guaranteeng that I won't be able to do what the job is asking. As an example, I'm somewhat talented at computer security, and I enjoy messing around on my own with it, but in an employment scenario, instead of just doing what needs to be done, I'm suddenly gonna have to write a report, and present a slideshow, or some other bureaucratic garbage which as I said, is designed to fulfill some need other than the immediate requirements of the job, which is where I struggle.

So anyway, just to finish my history. I went to middle school until I left in the 7th grade when I dropped out and became homeschooled again, which didn't actually entail much official schooling. I mostly just educated myself on stuff I happened to be interested in. My parents knew I couldn't take public school anymore. I went to a community college during the time that I was finishing up my homeschooling time. It took me over five years but eventually I got a associates degree and in college I suffered from all the same problems I laid out before. But I did get the degree. It's useless for me however.

So, I'm now in a situation where I've kind of accepted that I can't get a job. If I were to go to an interview, I'd be far too awkward and unable to follow the instructions during the interview, both in preparation for it and in terms of answering the questions during it. Secondly, if I did ever get a job somehow, I'd be fired within a couple weeks as soon as the employers see that I can't perform. My parents have been understanding to some degree and have supported me up until now, but our financial situation is much tighter now and I really want to try and help out, even though I know I can't.

I would say that the only job I could really get would be some kind of job where the boss tells you exactly what to do and there's no reading between the lines whatsoever. For example, the boss says ""take this shovel and move these rocks from this pile into that pile."" I can do that, but even with manual labor, a lot of it is too difficult for me to interpret what they're asking me to do. Does anyone have any advice on what I should try to do? I basically just want some kind of manual labor job (not dissing manual labor at all here, just to be clear) where I don't really have to engage in deep thought about what's going on. I was thinking maybe some kind of assembly line job could be possible. I really want to try and find something here, but I don't really think there's a specific job that allows for simple manual labor like that. Do such jobs exist, and if so, what sort of titles would they be under and how might I apply for it? I I just wonder what happens to people like me sometimes. I mean what if I can't get any kind of job? I live in the US and we have basically no welfare state whatsoever. Especially since I've never had a job, they won't give me anything. I guess I'm just gonna be homeless, but I think I might have missed some kind of opportunity in the form of a simple, manual labor job that doesn't require previous experience in carpentry or construction or anything like that, and that doesn't require any of the thinking on your feet that I'm so bad at.

Background:
Bachelors in Economics
Masters in International Relations 

I got dragged into the tech world a few years ago (after several years of completely unrelated experience).

During the period of employment, I started working more and more in tech related roles. It was a start up and so I wore several different hats. 

Here is a rough breakdown of responsibilities:

- 5% QA (writing test cases, assigning tickets, creating QA timelines)

- 15% Product management (wireframe, get client requirements, talk and design with engineers)

- 30% operations (writing SQL queries - Oracle/SQL server, building tableau dashboards) 

- 30% data analytics (creating segments, data cleaning, regressions - mostly in Excel, R)

- 20% random stuff 

Questions:

1)Out of these, which do you believe has a higher earning potential over time?

Data Analyst 

Product management/BA

I’ve already decided I’m not going to college. I can’t stand school, I literally stare at the clock for half the day. Combine this with the fact that I’m just not that bright of a person on must subjects. I’m an average student grade wise (B’s and C’s with A’s in those easy electives).
I’ve never really had a set career that I’ve wanted to pursue. I’m really interested in aviation but I just suck at math and anything science or physics related.
I also tend to be kind of anti-social. I like being alone and private when I’m not in school or at my part time cashier job at a local grocery store. I don’t get invited to the typical high school parties and the such.
I’m kind of lost and need some help. Thanks!",1583042051.0,2020-03-01 00:54:11,March
717,717,"Proposed salary cut by 20% due to COVID19, what do I do?",118,frozly,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/frozly/proposed_salary_cut_by_20_due_to_covid19_what_do/,36,"Location: Australia
Industry: Manufacturing
Employees: 450+

Today all employees at my workplace were issued a letter stating our hours are going to be cut back by 20% (work 4 days as opposed to 5). We are required to sign and send back acceptance of the proposal in the next two days.

Is this legal?

The individual contract I signed at the start of my employment states I'm on a salary with a regular working week of 38 hours.

I am in a finance position and I know sales have not been impacted to the extent that measures like this need to be put in place. Maybe the board is just taking precautions, but I can't help but feel they are using the whole coronavirus saga as a cover to cut labour costs for the foreseeable future.

I'd like to hear your opinions on the matter. Thanks in advance for the feedback.

EDIT: through my research I can conclude it comes down to the wording of the letter your company provides. If it's a request or proposal to change your hours - totally legal. You can decline to sign and then face whatever repercussions come of that. If the company does not give you an option and adjusts your salaried hours without consent - not legal and you can take the case further if you wish. 

I hope this helps anyone that's in the same situation.",1585596138.0,2020-03-30 15:22:18,March
745,745,"My job is NOT what I signed up for, do I continue to voice my concern to my boss or do I take a different approach and start looking for other work?",114,ffo6lw,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ffo6lw/my_job_is_not_what_i_signed_up_for_do_i_continue/,36,"Some quick background information - I recently graduated from my second undergraduate degree in Finance. For approximately 7 months, I  have been working in a Business Analyst (BA) role for a utilities company and have previous held the same role position for a financial institute (as work experience for my degree).  I have a general idea of the career as I'm currently educating myself in the evenings so I can start my CPA designation as I see myself in an analysis/accounting role. The job market where I currently live is not the greatest so I applied for basically every entry level analyst job I could find and took the first one I could get (for financial reasons, I needed money and I needed it fast).

Here's the thing - I'm an entry level employee and I'm interested in finding a job where I can learn both  from hands on experience and mentoring, but I understand I have to keep my head down and do the mundane ""chore"" tasks that get assigned to me. Anyways, when I interviewed for the role, I made sure to ask questions about mentorship, where my duties would be focused, areas for growth and potential opportunities to learn, etc. The job was laid out to be an analysis role focused on process improvement and documenting, data gathering, interpretation and modelling. Unfortunately, outside the process modelling, I don't do much of the work mentioned above. 

To make matters worse:

1. There is a huge internal company project going on that limits the amount of money that is spent on projects outside of this initiative - basically new work is not exactly going to happen for the next 2-3 years because of this. 

2. My department is split into two teams: the BAs and the Operational Support team (OS). There is a massive growth plan for the support team because the need for the technology support is growing much faster than the team right now - which makes my role feel even more insignificant.

3. My manager has spoken to me about how my role will be shifting to accommodate the support team and I will likely be acting as a tool for them to use when they need to create/model processes or documentation. 

4. My current projects involve developing internal contests (which we are now not going to run), maintaining a website, documenting communication strategies, creating bi-weekly presentations for a stand-up meeting, other small one-off mundane tasks and supporting a technology upgrade (this one actually makes sense and fits scope).

I have voiced my concern, and my manager essentially responded with training will likely be through hands-on only, and your role will be shifting to more of a support role. I don't want to seem ungrateful because I'm lucky to have a job but I have slim to no mentorship, little support from my manager, and it is turning into a completely different job than I interviewed for. 

As you may have guessed, the culture is not the greatest either but that's beside the point. I feel like I'm stuck in a job where I'm learning near nothing, I feel underappreciated and I'm truly worried for my long-term career. I'm young and looking for opportunities to grow, learn and build a career so I'm a little scared I'm heading into the wrong direction and something needs to be done (I just don't know what).

Anyways, I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining, I just feel stuck. I'm just hoping to get anyone's advice on this or personal experience with something similar. Do I continue to voice my concerns or is there something better for me to do? Maybe it's at that point where I aggressively apply to new jobs and quit the one I'm in once I find a new one?

I really appreciate it, thank you to any responses in advance!",1583751826.0,2020-03-09 07:03:46,March

920,920,Starting over at 44: am I doomed?,87,fbugg8,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fbugg8/starting_over_at_44_am_i_doomed/,13,"So I'll be 44 this year, and I've been disabled throughout my adolescence and for all my adult life. I was diagnosed with autism at 42, and with ADHD at 43. Since entering treatment, my health has improved dramatically, and I'm now in a position to work towards things that I thought could only be dreams.

This poses a bit of a problem, since I have no idea what I want to do - or rather, I desperately wanted to study a language and then translate, but my home situation makes that difficult. I know that I want to go to university, but I have to decide what to study once I'm there, and what sort of work I not only want to do, but *will be able* to do. I'm educated to UK A-level standard, and am doing preparatory college courses to get me to the point I'm confident in my ability to tackle a degree.

I'm focused, driven and meticulous. I'm a problem-solver. I love data and detail. I love complex structures. I love puzzling out difficult things. I love going deep into one small field for years. I argue a lot, and I write well. I read very fast, and I'm a good researcher. I read Acts of Parliament and draw graphs for fun. I like numbers and logic. I do basic coding in around ten languages, and I use this constantly to fix problems around me. I do Japanese fan translations. ***I'm a learner*** - I love to study. Even at my worst, I've always worked to be better.

But I also have serious issues around my health. I can't do hard physical labour. I can't work routine long hours. I can work with people, but I'd need longer periods of working by myself. I put myself across well in writing, but in speech I come across as confused and inarticulate; I don't deal well with people. I have issues with memory and attention that make me prone to constant errors. I don't want to spend too much time in front of a computer, because it detaches me from the world that I need to be *in*, if I'm ever to accomplish anything in any job. I'd like to be able to work from home some of the time, but not all of the time.

I know I want to get a degree, just because it rankles that I've been to uni twice and don't have one. But I'm afraid that I'll take the risks, lose a lot, and still be unemployable at the end of it. I'll be in my 50s by the time I'm looking for work, an age when most people are terrified of losing their jobs because they'll never be rehired. And I don't know what my disability issues will look like in five years. I hope many will improve, but I would be a fool to think that many won't.

Am I fooling myself to think I can start out in a profession in my 50s, with no work history? Are there even careers for people like me?",1583100269.0,2020-03-01 17:04:29,March
