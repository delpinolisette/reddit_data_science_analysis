174,174,Why Do Nearly All Entry-Level Jobs Require Unrealistic Amounts of Experience or Certifications?,728,g6wil1,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/g6wil1/why_do_nearly_all_entrylevel_jobs_require/,240,"After 4 years of University undergrad, 2 years for an M.Sc, and 2 years as a research assistant within the general realm of microbiology/biochemistry/astrobiology, I have been trying get into literally any full time or permanent position I can find within the province of Ontario.

It does not benefit newcomers to the workforce in any way.

I check today and it says ""accepted contingent offer"" on the portal, and now I'm like wtf. I didnt have a chance to negotiate, there was no paper, there was no communication with me about anything. In the interview however, my current boss did say  theyd like me to stay. But forgive me if I'm mistaken, but normally I myself have to agree to their offer, not they accept it without.

Just like any normal person, we usually try to weigh our options etc. I do not know if they are just assuming I'm wanting to stay and they are my only choice, because it's not and I also made that clear in the interview.

I’m looking for new jobs and am getting zilch. The interviews I’ve had, where they asked why I left, the tone immediately changes when I tell them I was assaulted. They basically ask what I did to deserve getting attacked.

So as a hiring manager, do you reject me the moment you hear something like that? Do I have to keep this company off of my resume and pretend it never happened? Is there a better way to put that this guy thought I was coming for a promotion he wanted and he resorted to battery?

I hate to think that some meathead putting hands on me has covered me in an unhirable stink, but it seems like it.

I also unexpectedly made a really weird sound as I spoke without breathing after someone asked me a question and gasped for air on the last word which people heard. Things like this have happened which definitely came across as socially awkward. If not these, then in video group chats, I come across as very quiet.

They also said I have an ""excellent resume"", and while the market looks really rough for work these days, I think they will actually do their best to place me. Really glad with how this turned out.

Thanks to everyone for your advice. I was nervous as hell, but I did some prep, had a few answers in my back pocket, and it was definitely one of my better interviews in recent memory.

\------------------------------------------------

So I met with a recruiter 6 years ago when I was having a lot of trouble looking for work. I was nervous as hell but I tried my best to prep, came in with copies of my resume and work samples, bought presentation material, etc.

Basically, the recruiter said that unless I'm ""an expert"" at a particular skill, it shouldn't be on my resume, and that I must be lying on my resume. It was literally the worst interview experience of my life.

Turns out I have a zoom interview for a job next week with this same person. I just lost my job and this opportunity would be a good one, but I have less than zero interest in talking to this person again.

I'm all for constructive criticism, I'd love some on my resume in fact, but what this person did was just demeaning.

I get nervous on interviews as it is, and I'm legitimately not sure how I'm going to do this. Is there a professional way to handle this? Should I just suck it up and do it? Xanex (seriously)?

***Edit:*** *Whoa, this blew up way more than I thought it would.*

*It's pretty clear I have probably have a good amount of emotion invested in this experience that this person may not even remember. I need to do some prep work for sure, but how it goes from there I think will be determined by their professionalism.*

*It's a job I would like, but wouldn't make my career or anything, so it's not worth taking abuse for, but it's been a while since I've been on an interview, so best to at least get this under my belt and do the best I can with it.*

I wouldnt say i suck at it, but im not great either. I need a lot of help all the time and makes mistakes that should be obvious that i shouldnt do in my field, it's frustrating and embarassing that im not doing well at my job even though i really want to. Since the bank is so big, and my team is almost at the core of everything functioning well, theres some pressure to perform accordingly. Although my colleagues are very nice i feel like i am a disappointment to them. I thought it would get better after some time and i would start performing well but im not. There is some improvements but not enough. 

I work in a lot of different projects, one day i am building a solution in sql while the next day im doing c# for a webapp and i never really learn one language well enough that im comfortable doing it. 

It wasnt so bad until  maybe 4 months ago, when we got a new colleague (also fresh on the job market). He also had a bit of a slow start, but he is already doing better than me and people rely on him for getting stuff done. No one relies on me like that. And the daily standup meetings has become only anxiety for me as he progresses and im stuck. The reason why im writing this now, is because im feeling so down and almost giving up since he solved an issue ive been trying to solve for WEEKS. he solved it in maybe 7 hours.

I dont want to show up at work, i feel anxiety and showing signs of not doing well mentally because of work lately. i dont want to quit because i hope i can get better like him soon, but at the same time im afraid i wont ever be.

I was diagnosed with autism at 17 but I never view myself as autistic and never went to learn more about the condition. 

Since I was 13 years old, my goal in life was to get a job (and date but that's another subject). I never knew how people got a job though and so I recreated it. Anything and everything was like a job to me. School, boy scouts, church (I am non-religious but damn I learned every single thing in these classes because they gave out real-valued items that I sold for $100+ dollars, all hail the all mighty dollar), lemonade stands, video games, eating well and exercising. 

In fact, the main struggle is that, unlike school or the vast majority of hobbies/activities (even video games), I was never forced to get a job. And so I got carried away in my little bubble world of pseudo-jobs. In fact, I honestly do not believe I have been ""unemployed"" in a sense that all my philosophy regarding any activity was the economics of the situations. Food economics (higher calorie meals tend to give a biased dopamine reaction), game economics (played Eve Online and learned many things regarding human behavior), and the economics of churches providing free donuts (going back to the food bias), and school economics (the grade bias).  

That continued until I turned 30 and I have still never had a job. Most of my time has been spent being in limbo of inaction and playing video games. I have sold most of my video games however so I just watch YouTube videos for the most part. The sea of the internet has an infinite quality that gets overwhelming. 

 I still live with my parents, have no friends, never had a relationship, no college degree, and cannot drive a car.

Because the first step always seemed to be something forced onto me and then I would take up responsibility for it. I was an AP honors student. I had an unweighted highschool GPA of 3.9 (it was the hardest thing ever). I did 5 years of college and had a GPA of 3.8. I studied constantly because I could not read well and had to re-re-re-read things. I couldn't tell you why I was doing school except that deep down I felt it was my job, the why didn't really matter, and I need to take responsibility for the current situation. I never did any executive long-term planning for a career because I felt like, action wise, I was already having a job. 

I did not graduate college because my failed long-term planning led to an identity crisis and created a nervous breakdown.
