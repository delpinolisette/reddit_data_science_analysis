After graduating from college I wasn’t getting anywhere due to lack of experience.  I somehow lucked into my current job at an early stage startup where I got given a chance. My boss (CEO) seemed nice and friendly, and first few weeks seemed fine enough that I thought this could be a place I could grow into. We had lunches together and talked about the kind of work to be done and expectations of support I will need.

But then suddenly, my boss’s attitude changed and he started swearing a lot and becoming abusive. I think this coincided with the CTO resigning. So because we became short staffed, my boss started throwing work at me which I was completely unqualified for. He also casually blackmails me saying “he’ll destroy my career if I don’t deliver on my work” or “ruin my life in ways I haven’t even thought of”. After I barely manage to scrape through a deliverable, he suddenly becomes friendly again. 

For my next deliverable, I’ve already been sent work to do over the weekend and honestly I am completely out of my depth... I would normally do as I am told, but the fact is, I am too slow. I am just a novice programmer and I’m expected to produce the work of someone with 10 experience with no support.

I’ve started to get nightmares and woke up this morning in a pretty terrible state. 

I don’t really know what to do next because it’s obvious my boss will blacklist me in this industry if I try and get another job...

She started with the company in 2010 at $30 an hour. It's been 10 years and they never offered her a raise. Not once. Nothing. She recently asked for a raise and they offered her a measly dollar. The problem is wages in the private sector are right around $25-$30 an hour for my state. She's definitely in the top 20% of salary earners but it's pretty demoralizing knowing you're making less money than you were 10 years ago when you adjust for inflation.

How do companies go about handling raises for tenured employees? After all if they can get a young RN and pay them $25 an hour why would they want to pay my aging mother anything more than $30? Is this a problem with the company or just the economy in general? I feel like going 10 years without even a small raise to compensate for inflation is just god awful for a company to do to an employee.

Should she try to find another job or just stay put? Obviously wages have to get raised eventually. She shouldn't be making $30 in 2010 and then $31 in 2020 and $32 in 2030. Somethings got to give, right?",1582331341.0,2020-02-21 19:29:01,February

What are my options?",183,f0pysh,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/f0pysh/after_more_than_a_decade_of_trying_ive_come_to/,72," I'm turning 30 in a few months and don't really have anything to show for it. Since I was about five years old I've been 'the computer guy' to my family and friends, and while I've had other interests along the way, most have been for fun and not necessarily something I could make a profit off of, or make into a lifestyle. I've been swapping parts and making upgrades since before I was allowed to use the stove. In the past I've been steered back into tech whenever I decide on a whim to do something differently, because according to my friends, my folks, my family, etc, ""you have an innate knowledge for how machines work, and you're very socially awkward, so tech is perfect for you"".

I went to college for Computer Science, and my professors told me I wasn't cut out for it. I figured, that's nonsense, I'm the computer guy, if I work hard enough and believe I can do it I can be a success story just like every other success story I've read about. Turns out the real world doesn't work that way, and I was transferred to the 'web and game design' major. They didn't want me in that department either but I managed to stick it out. I took a ton of unrelated electives to bring up my GPA enough to stay in school (I don't regret that because I got to take some very cool classes), and I eventually graduated with a very poor major GPA (and a great non-major GPA) and have worked a bunch of Geek Squad/Apple Store/helpdesk related jobs, and a smattering of retail/food service jobs as well.

I've done countless hours of research on how to become a software engineer or IT professional. If I had to guess I'd say somewhere around 12000-18000 hours. Researching bootcamps, languages, putting together websites, doing FreeCodeCamp, going to tech nights and hackathons, it's been a ride for sure. I signed up for HackReactor, Thinkful, AppAcademy, Operation Spark, they all told me I don't have the knack but I kept trying, figuring eventually it'd all click and at that point the pieces would just fall into place. A little while ago I decided I'd make one final effort to make this happen, I enrolled in college for my second Bachelors at a 'go at your own pace' college, this time in Computer Science, and somehow this time I've been able to stick with the program, though I'm much slower than my peers and on average it takes me twice as long to finish courses.

Well, six months into the program and I'm slowly beginning to realize that the reason I've never really been able to 'get it' is that I genuinely hate working with computers, and that scares the hell out of me. In the past few weeks I've found myself doing all the household chores I normally can't stand to procrastinate having to write code/study. I sit down, scroll up and down my 'notes' page a couple times, and say ""you know, I don't think the shower has been re-grouted in a while, better get on that"". My entire identity, for the past 24+ years, has been based on the idea that at some point I'll be some big shot tech guy. I literally have no other skills.

I feel like I've put all of my eggs (and at this point, enough money to buy a small home) into being 'the computer guy' and if I'm not that, I'm literally starting over from scratch. Technically starting from pre-scratch, because I honestly have no idea what else is out there. People online always say ""start with what you like"" but in my case I have no idea what I like because I've never tried anything else. I know I can't join the military, or go into the trades, because I'm moderately disabled (both mentally and physically).

Normally, not having gotten a review by now wouldn’t be that big of a deal, except for the following:

I started on a Monday, and on Friday I was offered another position that was more in line with my background, and told that it would pay better as well. Of course I accepted, and after about 3 weeks I assumed the new role. 

Once in the new position, I was instrumental in literally saving the department from collapse, and it is now more profitable than its ever been. 

I was instrumental in helping collect over $35,000 from a client due to a past connection with them (I’m not in finance or collection, and through my connections was able to clear up some communication issues that got us paid quickly) 

At my 90 day mark, my manager was terminated. This has nothing to do with my specific department as he wore several hats, but it did require my partner and I to work more independently. We now manage our department with minimal supervision. 

I’ve also brought in two successful referrals, who are doing well. I’ve brought in guests to speak with management about opportunities to expand and strategies for making that successful. 

Normally, I wouldn’t be upset over not getting a raise within the first year, but I was told I would get a review, then offered a promotion which I have done a great job with...and no increase in pay... am I wrong for being pissed? I’ve mentioned it a couple times but I’m done beating a dead horse. Is it wrong of me to be looking just because of this? It feels very much like a broken promise, about money as well as recognition.

Working in a warehouse was too loud, boring, and didn't pay enough to survive.

Now I'm working in nonprofit admin. I can't deal with spending 8 hours a day in an office full of people, just physically being present at work takes all the energy I have. I continually miss grant application deadlines and take way to long to respond to emails because I am so mentally exhausted that I often can't type cohesive sentences.

I will likely be out of a job soon and I just don't know what to try next. I have not seen any jobs I feel well suited to, and I'm curious if anybody has any recommendations for someone who hates being around other people and falls to pieces when confronted with any stressful situation.

I have two bachelors degrees and did very well in school, however I have performed very poorly in every job I've had so far. I'm not interested in programming as I am not capable of coding proficiently.

815,815,"Girls, what would you do if you noticed that your boyfriend (and colleague) is treated better than you in your same workplace, with same duties?",102,ex2eam,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/ex2eam/girls_what_would_you_do_if_you_noticed_that_your/,27,"I [21F] feel like I'm being treated differently in my new workplace. I know I should probably be quiet because I receive my salary, and this is what job is supposed to give you. However, I'm really hurt. I feel bad, with no gratification. The fact that I'm always treated differently makes me feel like I'm a bad person and I don't know what to do.

Let me first tell you that the job consists in taking care of animals for a company. We DO NOT have personal relationships with our superiors because we don't work together. Our job is really lonely and nobody sees us when we work. The only way our superiors know we have done the job is because we sign a paper when we start and finish the job: nothing more. No personal relationship to justify such behaviours.

I, biology student, got hired after a regular job interview. It went amazingly: they seemed to be really happy about what I did and how I think. I felt like I had found the right place for me.
After the interview I was asked to work 6 hours every day for my first month in order to do some practice, even though I got hired to work during the weekend. After that, I just did my weekend job.

On the other hand things have been a bit different for my boyfriend [26M], psychology student, when was hired. He got the job because he was unemployed and after a few months working there I suggested him to try the interview as well even if the job isn't consistent with his studies.

The interviewers knew he was my boyfriend and I think this helped him being hired: he told me that when they found that out they said nice words about me and their attitude changed instantly towards him too. He was also prepared because since I did the interview before him I knew exactly what they were looking for and I gave him some advice too.

However, the differences in the treatment between us were clear from the beginning.

In chronological order:

First of all, during the interview they gave my boyfriend free gadgets and a book. I have never received anything from them and I'm sure it's not because I'm a bad employee or something.

In addition, nobody asked him to work 6 hours everyday for the first month to do some practice like I did, even if he needed it more than me (at least I'm a biology student and I studied zoology, he is a psychology student and knows NOTHING about animals). He started immediately with the weekend job and at the moment we have the same duties.

Furthermore, at Christmas he received a present from the company (nothing personal: if that was from a friend, I wouldn't be bothered) and I didn't. I honestly don't care about the present: it was nothing I wanted or needed, but I was hurt by the fact that I wasn't (again) treated equally.

Moreover, he got his contract renewed only after 3 months he got hired. They told me I was going to be having it renewed too as well, but besides words, no facts. I had to ask THE DAY BEFORE its validity passed and only then they renewed my contract. And also, I noticed that my contract is shorter than my boyfriend's one, for no reason. Same job. Same duties. Mine will last until 11/2020; his will last until 12/2020. I've worked there for a longer time, plus I did a month full time too and I don't know how to justificate this difference between us: I worked more and I'm more prepared. Never caused troubles, always had a positive attitude and I'm friend with every colleague now.

Finally, yesterday we received our salary and he got 1/3 MORE than he was expecting (we are paid for the amount of hours done), while nobody ever gave me an Euro more.

What do you think of this situation? What do you recommend me to do?


TLDR: same workplace and job, but even if my bf got hired after me and the job isn't consistent with his studies, he was given presents and my same duties without the daily 6-hours month of practice I was supposed to do and receives a higher salary and better contract renewal.

Wondering what reasons exist not to do that that I may not have considered yet.  

I'm in the military with a gross annual income of about $92,000. I've decided to leave once my contract is up in early April instead of reenlist. I'm stationed in Maryland but I really want to move back home to Colorado, I've just been holding out for a decent enough job there. I figured it wouldn't be hard to land a job here in Maryland (basically doing the same job I have in the military but as a civilian) so my plan was to do that first just to keep paying the bills while I look for a Colorado job.

I interviewed for a Maryland job on Wednesday and a Colorado job on Thursday. Both sent recommendations to HR to hire me, and both hiring managers said this almost certainly means an impending job offer. Maryland job pays $118,000 and aligns perfectly with my experience, while the Colorado job pays around $66,000 and is a sort of partial career shift since it aligns with only part of my experience. Now you probably think I'm crazy for preferring the Colorado job but living there is my dream and I'm not happy here in Maryland.

Anyway, I *could* just accept the Colorado job and decline the Maryland job. But I'd be lying if I said I don't want to collect at least one month of that fat salary from the Maryland job (about $9,800 gross) before moving to Colorado to start the other job. And the Colorado job could probably be flexible with the start date by a month or two. But of course, that means I'd be having the Maryland company commit whatever resources to getting me spun up on that job only to quit soon after.

Both companies do a lot of government contracting work. The Maryland company even has jobs out in Colorado too, similar to the Colorado job I'd be taking. If I leave Maryland company so soon, do you think it will burn the bridge for any job opportunities with them in Colorado? Is there a way to mitigate that aside from NOT leaving so early? Do you reckon it could damage me professionally beyond my relationship with the Maryland company, like other companies finding out how I left that company?",1581686226.0,2020-02-14 08:17:06,February
