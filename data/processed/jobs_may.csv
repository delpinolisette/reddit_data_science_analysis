I've seen a lot of posts right now specifically about how times are ""so tough"" followed by how they're proud to announce their new position at Amazon or whatnot.

The past 3 months have been such a godsend, not having to drive to work, get ready, make lunch (or get takeout), and constantly be in a rush just to sit in my windowless office to work for the next 8.5 hours. I get more time with my wife, my pets, and more time to do life things.

I am dreading going back when they open the office back up. I have been super productive during this stint, often working more than 9 hours per day at a productive rate, my deliverables have shown it too. 

I almost want to make a case with my office to allow me to do this full time, as I have never had such a quality-of-life improvement for something so simple.

243,243,"Has ""faking it till you make it"" gone too far?",630,gjrour,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gjrour/has_faking_it_till_you_make_it_gone_too_far/,155,"I personally feel like Corporate America has become overly focused on rewarding who can be the best narcissist and con artist, and it's hurting workplace performance, integrity, morale, and those who are more honest with themselves and those around them.

The fact is that a lot of us, even those of us who are experienced, are figuring things out as we go.  Secondly, no two jobs or organizations are the same, so finding a perfect segue from one job to another is nearly impossible.  To then have to lie about your current experience or abilities to get a job, and then have to live up to these expectations, helps nobody.  

As someone who tries to be forthcoming and honest at work about expectations (and maybe a little too much so), I've seen it hurt my opportunities so many times.  Furthermore, I see people in positions that they should never be in, simply because they were better at selling the lies about where they're genuinely at with regards to skills and experience.  Their inexperience and lack of skill, as a consequence, often hurt morale and productivity of the team they are placed on or oversee.  

In contrast to this, I think the hiring process should be more transparent and forthright from all parties.  Maybe this transparency will lend more to opportunities of getting actual formalized on-the-job training, mentorship, and advancement opportunities.  If everyone isn't out there lying or faking it to get a job, then companies would have no choice but to invest in training and development if they want to find the candidates they are seeking.  Furthermore, it'd help morale and productivity on teams because then you're not dealing with the repercussions of a manager or colleague who is out of their element trying to *fake it till they make it*.   

What are your thoughts?  Has faking it till you make it gone too far in the sense that it creates an environment where the best con artist wins out, and then everyone else is forced to deal with the consequences of a poor hiring decision when there are no formal training or mentor programs in place to accommodate?

272,272,Should I be ashamed that I am NOT ambitious and eager to climb the career ladder?,593,gpqje6,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gpqje6/should_i_be_ashamed_that_i_am_not_ambitious_and/,138,"Hey there. I have been thinking about this for quite some time now. Multiple comments and interactions with various people, both from my own family, friends and colleagues over the years have prompted me to think:

**Should I be ashamed that I am NOT ambitious and eager to climb the career ladder? Am I a loser in life for not placing more emphasis on my career?**

A little background about myself. I'm a teacher, and I graduated from a UK university in 2014 with first-class honours. Since then, I have been working as a teacher at a public secondary school.

A good number of my coursemates and also other teachers all seem to be planning their career developments very aggressively, from pursuing Masters while working full-time as teachers, participating and presenting papers in seminars and conferences, creating modules, conducting camps, etc etc......while I on the other hand am pretty.....*chill* about it.

Every year, all the time that I have during school holidays is solely dedicated to planning my lessons far ahead so that  I don't have to crack my head when school is in session. You can say I'm quite obsessed with planning. I'm very organised and I absolutely hate doing ad-hoc things. In fact, I even push myself to prepare materials for the entire year of club meetings even when it's not confirmed yet if I would be the club advisor, just because I like to plan.

It has benefited me so far, and because of this, I have a fairly good work-life balance. My life for the past few years up to now has relatively little stress. I come home from work in the afternoon, exercise in the evening, then dedicate a good 2 hours to read my beloved Kindle. And that's my cycle for the entire year. I don't go the extra mile. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely finish all the tasks required of me, it's just that first,  I don't like to procrastinate and like to get things done quick and second, I'm not married, so I guess I'm lucky in the sense that I have more time.

My lack of ambition wouldn't have bothered me, if not for the fact that people in the education sector (fellow teachers) AND also people OUTSIDE the education sector seem to have this perception that teachers should be noble beings who must sacrifice for students. I'm sorry, while I do care and try to help my kids where possible, I am just not one of those teachers who live and breathe school. If I go back at 3pm, I'm not going to think about school any longer. I think about other things, like planning my weekend grocery list, which cinema movies to look out for, books to read, etc etc

Because I graduated with first-class honours, my former lecturers, coursemates and even my own family feel that I am wasting away my talent and that I should do *something*. They seem to think that I shouldn't be content with what I am doing now. It's annoying as the ""clock"" is ticking and the pressure from them is increasing in the form of off-hand comments, and in turn I am often forced to plaster the world's worst fake smile. As a result, I have begun to feel like a loser lately, like I'm drifting aimlessly even though I am satisfied and happy with my life (little stress)

**TLDR; So I am asking the rest of you, should I be more ambitious? Is something wrong with me for going against the norm? Is it even a norm that one must progress in their career?**",1590359298.0,2020-05-24 18:28:18,May
303,303,My Experience From Job Hunting,555,gt144v,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/gt144v/my_experience_from_job_hunting/,88,"I have been passively searching for opportunities since December of 2019. This changed to a more active search in late February as my health insurance needs changed. As for some background, I've run my own small business for the past 5 years focused on financial analysis (read heavy in math and statistics) with a strong skill set in programming in excel and R. The reason for my search is I got tired of the bad health insurance I had, and wanted health insurance offered by a large firm.

I wanted to share my experiences and some advice that may benefit those currently in the grind of searching.

**The process of searching:**

1. Dedicate a fair amount of time for searching and applying to jobs. This is going to be a competitive endeavor now with 20 million people recently unemployed. The market has switched from begging you to come to work for us to ""why should we hire you?"".
2. Do not get discouraged if you do not hear back from a company, just move on. Based upon my data from my applications (\~200), the average time that I have heard back from a company interested in speaking to me has been 7 business days. The most common response time (the median) has been within 2 business days. I have had experiences where firms have contacted me 3 months after I applied.
3. Data is king during this process. Create an excel spreadsheet to track your process. This will let you know if you need to make changes to your resume to get through the resume / application screens. At the end, I outlined the data that I've collected and why.
4. I know this is a huge pain in the rear; however, update / customize your resume for every job. Read the job description and take note of words that are used more than once. It is very likely these words are what they will be searching for when they screen your resume and cover letter. I have had more success in getting through the screens after I combined my resume and cover letter together. Page 1 is resume, page 2 is my cover letter. I'm not sure if the resume filters also screen the cover letter, but this method provides more opportunities to get through the screen. Your goal in this step is just to get a human to look at your resume.
5. If you are applying for a position that is outside of your current geographic area, put on your resume a more local city, state and zip code. This will get you past the ""we only want local"" screen. If the application wants a full address, put down the address of a friend, family member, or a nearby apartment complex. If asked about it, explain that during this time I have moved back to be with family and want to find a position nearby to be close to them. This shows them that you already have a move planned and it also alleviates their fear that you will flake on showing up for the job.
6. Build in appropriate expectations for your search.

&#x200B;

* With the high level of unemployment, it is typical that a position will receive 200+ applications. If you get an invitation for a phone interview, this likely means that you were in the top 10 (not 10%) of candidates that applied. From this group, most firms typically will take half to advance to the second round. The second round to third round cuts down to 2 people.
* Be prepared to be ghosted. Out of my \~200 applications, I have had 40 phone interviews. Of these, 20 I have advanced to the next round. Of the 20 I did not make, 5 sent me the thanks but no thanks e-mail. Even if the phone interviewer seems impressed with you and talks about next steps and advancing you and what that process looks like, do not get too excited or attached to the position until the actual invite for the next round comes to you.

**Recruiters:**

I have have had the privilege to interact with all-star recruiters and the absolute worst of the bunch. The best recruiters are going to typically come from small, sub-specialized firms that only focus on a particular niche. You will absolutely know it when you talk to them. They are going to want to know why are you looking, what type of team / company you are looking to join, and will offer great assistance during the interview process. The all-star recruiters will not pressure you to sign a right to represent form.  They will typically spend 45 minutes to an hour talking with you.

Now for the dregs of the recruiting community. If a recruiter calls you and you can hear a lot of noise in the background, they are calling you from a phone farm. They make their money by volume and throwing as many resumes at a position as possible to secure their commission. They will often pressure you to sign a right to represent form (NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER sign these). By signing this form you are agreeing to let them represent you in the process of applying to firm. This can cause huge problems for you if you end up or have already applied to the firm. The recruiting firm will take the stance that they are owed a commission from the company, and it is easier for a company to pass on you so that they do not have to deal with this conflict.

These are the typical signs of a horrible recruiter:

* Lots of noise in the background
* Very brief conversation (less than 5 minutes) before asking if they can submit you to a position
* Pressure to sign a right to represent form
* They ask you to change the titles on your resume
   * never do this, if a company calls to check your employment history they will discover this
   * when companies check employment, they call your previous firm and ask for dates of employment and titles. This is all that HR can give out
* They ask you to add responsibilities that you did not have in previous roles on your resume
   * again, very easy to verify by pulling up job description from an old job posting of your prior role
* **They ask for your date of birth or social security number** (there is absolutely zero reason they need this information; NEVER GIVE THEM THIS INFORMATION)

There are what I would refer to as middle tier recruiters at very large job recruiters. I have had mixed experiences with them. Some of them are good, some not so good. I would at least listen to what they have to say.

**Interviews:**

A huge advantage during this unfortunate time is that most interviews are being done by telephone or a video meeting. This allows you to have up on your computer screen a script to answer the most common questions; however, in writing your script make sure to add in pauses and breaks to make it appear as if you are coming up with it off the top of your head. This is important since you are likely to be repeating these answers multiple times throughout the interview process with different companies and in various rounds with the same company. Being consistent with your answers within a company is important, they will compare notes between rounds and note discrepancies.

Do your research on the person(s) you will be talking to? Pull up their LinkedIn account and see if you have any common background (school, previous employer) or if they have something unique such as helping a local charity or other volunteer service. This is a great rapport builder.

**The initial phone screen:**

The initial phone screen breaks down into two parts: HR person telling you the salary range and benefits and basic questions about your qualifications.

In the initial phone screen, they will go over salary requirements, hours, benefits etc. Most HR people have stopped asking ""how much you currently make"" since this question is illegal in California, Illinois, and several other states. They will typically ask what salary range you are targeting. DO NOT ANSWER THIS QUESTION DIRECTLY, you can rule yourself out immediately with an answer that is too high or too low.

Instead phrase it as: A recruiting firm that I was speaking with provided me market data for the title and seniority level and it is an extremely wide range from a low of (name something that is 20% lower than whats on the low end of the Glassdoor salary range to 20% higher than the high end). I'm not trying to play games or waste anybody's time, but its hard to tell what a fair salary is without diving deeper into the specific responsibilities. What is your targeted range for the position? I have never had any problems with this response. I have always received a salary range from the HR person.

**THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS SAY YES THIS IS IN LINE WITH MY EXPECTATIONS or I WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION WITH THAT RANGE.**

>Even if the salary range is below what you are looking for or well below the market rate, still tell them YES.  The reason you do this is so that you can keep advancing through the interview process to get more practice in a live situation.  Repetition is going to help make you more comfortable in interviews, provide an opportunity to practice your answers, and most importantly gain exposure to different questions and interview styles (strict question answer format versus dialogue based).  This will help you for future interviews for positions that you really want.  Do not turn down any opportunities to learn, practice, and get more comfortable with the process.

The initial phone screen is preliminary test to see if you check the right boxes. They are looking to verify that you have the skills / experience listed on the resume match up with the requirements of the job. Be prepared to match at least one experience with every listed job requirement and preferred experience.

Also be prepared to answer the following questions:

* **Tell me about yourself** \[this is typically the very first question that you will be asked\]

This is the MOST important question of the initial phone interview!

Remember, this is your chance to brag about how great you are and how you would be an excellent fit for the job. Keep in mind that you were likely 10 people they selected to speak too.

Write out a narrative to have in front of you to act as guide. Don't just go into robot zombie mode reading it. Also customize it to match up with the specific job. Most jobs have a wide range of responsibilities from doing individual work to collaborative work. If the job posting mentions working with teams or interacting with senior management, highlight this aspect in your previous roles.

* **What attracted you to our company?**
* **What attracted you to this role?**

These are the three most important questions to nail. Do your research on the company website, LinkedIn, and twitter account. I have had great success when I have pointed out that I am attracted to the companies charitable side and have mentioned a specific charity that they supported or allow for volunteer days. For the specific role, I have highlighted how this was similar to a previous role or part of what I did in a previous role that I really enjoyed. For each of these, I have typically four or five bullet points written down to touch upon.

* Name three of your strengths
   * make sure that these match up with the job description
* Name three of your weakness
   * do not pull the strengths as weakness answers - ""I try too hard, I care too much""
   * Instead answer with realistic problems that you have, and HOW YOU MANAGE THEM!
      * For example, I answer this questions as follows:

Three of my greatest weaknesses are paralysis by analysis, frustrations when projects / work runs behind, and co-workers that are not putting forth an adequate level of effort. In focusing on wanting to make sure that I'm not paralyzed or taking too long on an analytical project, I seek feedback from colleagues on the completeness and scope of projects. I have had instances were I went beyond the scope of the task since I kept searching out more data. On my frustrations with the pace of projects and work being done, I make myself step back and take a 30,000 foot look to see how this could be impacting several different groups / divisions and to gain perspective that these decisions need to be thoroughly thought through to take the best action for the firm. In terms of co-workers that I don't feel are doing there best, I also take a step back and look at the totality of their work beyond what is impacting me directly. I am more mindful that they might have a lot on their plate, or possibly waiting on someone else. So I have taken a proactive approach to this to see how I may help them.

Make sure to have questions to ask the HR person interviewing you at the end. Even better if you can fit them into a conversation. More on Questions later.

My experience with the initial HR phone screens have varied widely based upon the experience of the person. My typical experience with a less tenured or fresh out of school HR person is that they are just going down a checklist to see if they can check the boxes with NO AUTHORITY to deviate what constitutes checking the box.

>Jr HR: Do you have experience with ABC Technology platform?  
>  
>Me: No, but I do have extensive experience with their competitors platform XYZ that is very similar to ABC.  
>  
>Jr HR: So, do you have experience with ABC tech platform?

If you experience this, just keep trying to let them know you have the skills. Although, you are likely not going to advance beyond the ""can I check the box?"" HR person. Keep giving it your best, but forget about the interview after its done and set your expectations accordingly.

My experience with tenured, seasoned HR recruiters has been extremely positive. They know you made the initial cut, and really want to get down into your skills and abilities even if they are on different systems or platforms than what their company utilizes.

>Sr HR: Do you have experience with ABC Technology platform?  
>  
>Me: No, but I do have extensive experience with their competitors platform XYZ.  
>  
>Sr HR: Oh that's great. They are pretty similar, you'll be able to pick it up quickly.

**1st Round Interview:**

Expect a repeat of the first round questions:

* Tell me about yourself
* What attracted you to our company?
* What attracted you to this role?

Depending upon the type of job, this round typically focuses on evaluating your technical ability to do the job. Be prepared to talk about examples of work that you have done that matches up with each bullet point of their requirements. Also be prepared to answer questions about the industry or field that the role is in.

Also in this round, be prepared for behavioral interview questions (the tell me a time . . . ). These typically follow a predictable theme. The typical format for answering these is S.T.A.R.

S/T = Situation or Task

A = what actions you took

R = result

Most people, nail the first two parts but trail off on the result. The result is the important part. Again, with interviews being done remotely, write these up in bullet point format and have up on your screen or written down to refer to when asked a question.

Expect to see questions on: Tell me a time when you . . .

* had a tight deadline or time crunch having to complete a task / project
* had difficulty with a co-worker
* had difficult / tough feedback from a manager
* had a difficult client interaction
* had to persuade someone
* had to teach a new skill to someone
* had a successful (or failed) project what did you do (or learn)

**2nd Round Interview:**

This is typically a fit interview. Do you fit in with the culture? Expect to be asked more behavioral questions. Also be prepared to talk about what motivates you, and what you want to achieve in this role.

This is quite often when you will be asked about ""Where do you see yourself in five years?"" You might get this question on the first phone interview, or even in the 1st round. So have this prepared from the get-go.

If you are asked this question in a 2nd or 3rd round interview, your answer better well involve being at the company. So here is the answer that I have provided in later rounds:

With great deference to the unpredictability of time and evolution and with a great deal of arrogance, I see myself working at XYZ company doing what needs to be done. In the short-term, I would be focused on beginning the process of mastering the role that we are talking about today. That is going to involve learning XYZ companies policies, procedures, technology, and general workflows as well as forming meaningful relationships with peers inside our group as well as those in other departments. In the intermediate term, I would be focused on deepening my expertise \[in something that you are really good at\], and continuing my development \[in something that you are weak in or just learning\] while also maintaining an open, adaptable mindset to learn new technologies, processes, or whatever is necessary to be of value in the future. If I continually focus on improving myself, adapting to the changing working environment, and building, developing meaningful relationships, I will be of tremendous value to the company as well as the flexibility to fit into ever evolving roles and increasing responsibility.

The basic premise of the where do you see yourself in fives years is to evaluate if you have a plan on self-improvement and how do you see yourself fitting in and continuously adding value to an organization.

**3rd/4th/5th Rounds**:

If there are interviews beyond the second round and they are with peers you would be possibly working with, they are measuring your ability to fit in and likability. These typically do not involve technical questions, but be prepared just in case. These are usually informal chats; however, you CANNOT treat them as informal. You are still be evaluated on if the person would want to spend 8 hours a day working with you. My advice is to find something in common off of their LinkedIn to ask them about. Throw in a couple of easy questions for them:

* Walk me through a typical day?
* What led you to XYZ company? Talk to me about your journey up the ranks at XYZ?
* What does it take to be successful in this role?

**Final Round:**

Congratulations, you have made it to the final two or three people out of possible 500 that applied for the job.

You will typically be interviewing with an extremely senior person. HR or the recruiter will tell you that this is your final round.

These interviews are typically very conversational, where the TOP DOG is trying to determine your motivations and how you will fit in with the team and the overall company. Keep in mind he/she has been told good things about you, otherwise you would not be speaking with them. Even though it is likely to be informal, still come prepared for the standard questions. Also come prepared to talk about what you learned from speaking with previous people. A common question that is asked is: tell me what you think our biggest problem is and tell me how you would help?

The follow-up questions that I've asked in the final rounds and have received a wow response are:

* Where do you see the company in five years?
* What makes a person successful at company xyz?

When its done reflect on your performance. If there is something that you did not explain well enough or come across clearly, utilize the thank you note to the HR person that has been setting up the interviews to expand upon your short-coming in the interview.

For example,

Dear HR Person,

I want to thank you for considering me for xyz position. I greatly appreciate the time and effort that you and \[list everyone's name that you spoke with\] have taken during the interview process. After spending the time talking with you and your team about this role, the \[insert name of position\] is even more appealing the more I learned about it. Specifically, \[name something cool about the role that you really like\]. Most importantly, I can really see myself working alongside \[names of peers that you have spoken with\]

After reflecting on my interview with THE BIG CHEESE, I realized that I might not have clearly explained abcdefg. I want to make sure that he/she knows that \[what you want to clarify or expound upon\]

If you or your team have any questions, please feel welcomed to reach out to me. I would be more than happy to answer them.

Thank you,

Your Name

**Questions:**

It is extremely important to ask questions during the process. It indicates that you are genuinely interest in the role and finding more about the company than is available on the website.

**The most important question to ask when they ask if you have any questions is to lead with:**

>Do you have any questions or reservations about skills or abilities so that I may have an opportunity to address them?

If they answer no, this is a positive sign. If they respond that they do, this provides you a second chance to highlight that you have the ability, skills or experience to do the job.

* For the initial phone screen:
   * What is the most important aspect of this role? (this will provide you another chance to highlight how you are a fit)
   * What led you to join XYZ company? or What has kept you at XYZ company (if they are tenured).
   * What is one thing that surprised you about working at XYZ company that you didn't know before walking in on your 1st day? (this will let them talk and provide you more information to utilize in the next round of interviews)
* For 1st & 2nd Round (These are typically with a manager of the group you are looking to join):
   * What makes someone successful in this role? (another chance to show how you would be a good fit with a follow-up response)
   * What is a your biggest challenge or point of pain that you are facing? (another place to step in with your previous experience)
   * What led you to XYZ company? What has kept you at XYZ company?
   * What does a typical day look like?

**Job Tracking Excel Sheet:**

* Column A: Company Name
* Column B: Job Title
* Column C: Job ID #
   * This will help avoiding to double apply through a recruiter and directly through the company's website
* Column D: Downloaded Job Description (Yes or No)
   * Make sure to download the description or print and save as a PDF. This will help if the company removes the job posting from their website or LinkedIn. This will also help avoid applying through a recruiter and the company directly
* Column E: username (for online application)
* Column F: Password
   * some companies websites are a mess to get a reset password, especially for government jobs
* Column G: Date Applied (type in date of application)
* Column H: Days Since Application
   * =IF(ISBLANK(G2),"""",ABS(TODAY()-G2))
* Column I: Phone Interview (Yes or No)

I'm mostly frustrated with myself because I don't know what I want to do but at the same time career advisors also seem to have no idea what they're doing unless you know what you want to do. Seems like they're only there to validate you instead of helping. I tested this by telling my career advisor I wanted to go into documentary filmmaking after studying urban geography and she was like yea go for it! I'm just feeling lost and wondering how people here found their careers, if you planned your career or if your career fell into your lap/you stumbled in on it. What resources would you guys recommend for finding jobs/career planning?

Edit: thanks for all the support! I want to provide some clarification. I'm going into my fourth year of university so while I think documentary filmmaking is really cool I've never taken a film class and can barely hold a camera so I don't think that's a career I can go into. I told her making money was important to me and she recommended activism as a full time job. She also tried to fight me on my  own experiences because she noticed I changed my major. I used to be in international development and I realized how terrible and degrading humanitarian work is. I told her it was absolutely a field I would not consider since humanitarian work actually perpetuates the cycle of poverty in developing countries and she said ""well in those countries it's step by step u know"".

She’ll forward it to me the same morning but it’s early enough in the morning that I’m either sleeping or haven’t checked my work emails yet. She sent one to me this morning after a long weekend and I missed the meeting. 
How should I respond to this?

Update: 
My boss and I had a 1-1 where she told me she was surprised I did not join the meeting. I told her I checked my email late last night to see if she had set up a meeting and she didn’t. Just for more info this was a meeting that she had mentioned she would set up which is why I was looking for the invite last night and since I didn’t see one I assumed it wasn’t yet scheduled.

More info— 
My boss told me about this meeting at 4:30pm on Friday over a call and she had mentioned she would “probably” set when one up Tuesday morning. We had a long weekend so when I checked my email last night (Monday night, a holiday) there was nothing there, so I assumed “okay she probably ended up not setting up the meeting”. Not only this but when I got the email invitation today it turns out she sent the email invitation out earlier than the meeting that took place with me on  on Friday where she told me she would probably set up a meeting. I asked her to send me an invite as soon as she set it up. Given that she is my manager I did not think I need to keep following up with her on a meeting that she told me she would set up and send. Also, even if at any point I had followed up with her, the soonest I would have gotten a response is early Tuesday morning  (since Monday was a holiday).

Im a 23 y/o Female and I only have ever worked casually (high school through to March this year). I worked in retail all through uni. Due to the economy here in Australia (im talking before covid19), I struggled to also get the hours I wanted in these casual positions as a 18-22 year old and probably wasnt the best worker due to my mental health issues. I tried so hard though.

From Jan-March this year I worked in administration for a not for profit. This role was only 15 hours a week and I only got it through nepotism (spent a bit under a year volunteering in that role beforehand). In this admin role, I was told that they couldnt pay me when the manager returned from her trip that was cancelled due to Covid-19, and thats why I left in March (Laid off I guess). They didnt explicitly state if it was due to not actually being able to justify my role or simply Corona-virus. I had a casual contract till Dec 2020 in this role.  I was disappointed because I found the work easy and they constantly ask me to do work for them now (Im still volunteering for them).

Anyway thats a bit of background.

Im struggling to find work in my field and I just dont know what to do. Ive suffered from serve anxiety and depression since I was in highschool.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce, in International Relations and Legal Studies, with a distinction average (mid 70s average mark). The Legal Studies side is basically like 'qualifications' in legal secretary work. However, I found out too late its extremely difficult to get into legal admin work without connections. International Relations is an arts major, but the majority of my high achieving class mates are now working in grad roles for high level government departments or international organisations etc. Due to my legal studies major, I could do a J.D Law Degree in 2 years if I wanted to, but I dont really want to be a lawyer, plus Australia is super saturated with unemployed lawyers who hold average intelligence.

I found it hard to put in applications while I was finishing at uni, but between July last year (when i graduated) and November 2019, I put in about 100 applications.  70 of those would of been relevant positions to my degree. Of those 70, I had about 5 face to face interviews and about 2 phone interviews. All obviously weren't successful. A lot of these positions I couldn't get past the psychometric testing part of the application process (when they were graduate roles)

(I applied to a broad range of graduate programs in both the public and private sector- to entry level admin/sales/support positions i could use as a stepping stone.) I know its not alot, but most people with the same degree havent had this issue, and my anxiety was so bad after I while, I admit I gave up.

I stopped applying when I landed a Christmas retail position I working in up to 50 hours a week- then i moved onto the nepotism admin role in Jan. Ive been applying again from Jan this year but no Luck. Then Coronavirus hit and I just have been ignoring the entry level roles now because everyone is on a hiring freeze and focusing on graduate programs which would start next year.

Things I want to mention/clarify

1. Ive had my CV/Resume run over about 5 times with a career councillor. They think its pretty good so im not sure what else I can do. I ustilise the S.T.A.R method to demonstrate my experience/volunteering etc on my CV. Its two pages long, which is normal in Australia for graduates.
2. I  dont have an internship under my belt. I tried very hard to get an internship, literally got one in my last semester, they said 'you can start on Monday"" -then I  got a call four hours later saying they could'nt give me the internship after all. The 'big boss' didnt think he could run me through the ropes or something before he left for a holiday.. Im not sure if this was just an excuse, but this was for a professional partisan Industry chamber lol. It blew my confidence massively.
3. I have 2 years experience in 2 volunteering roles. Basically event management/fundraising and supporting refugees and migrants integrate/learn English.
4. I write each individual cover letter from scratch to suit the companies needs/utilise key words. Every, single time no matter the role.
5. Im not picky. I realise at my age, I can try anything or any industry. I just want to get my foot in the door. Like I said, I have applied to 'very top' graduate government roles- to local council admin job roles- to entry level admin jobs for small businesses to KPMG, EY etc.

I honestly think Im just a dumbass, and I will never be able to land a full time job. If I cant make it past most of the psychometric testing in these graduate jobs, it must be true, right?

Also because of my anxiety, a lot of the positions Im too afraid to apply for.  I look at the skills and experience and I freak out. An admin role asking for 3 years experience? Forget about it. I've realised I dont actually have many solid technical skills, despite, obviously a pretty much worthless degree and vague transferable skills.

Its so disheartening. Im really not sure what I should do. None of my close friends went to uni, are unemployed or work in completely different industries. My dad is a mechanic and my mum has been a home-maker for 30 years.

What should I do? Should I continue to apply for graduate roles, or focus on very low level admin/business/sales roles and go from there?

Her question is simple enough, but I'm worried it's going to open a door to her constantly asking me questions. Then I'll be doing work for free. Her question also seems like she put no critical thought before coming to me.

I mostly feel like the company laid me off, they can deal with whatever consequences of that without me. If they feel like they need me, they can give me my job back.

Edit: it was an email from someone at work to my personal email. And this person 100% knows I was laid off. Thanks for all the feedback.

* I can't get experience without having experience.

* I can't achieve accomplishments without having accomplishments.

* I can't get a job network without having a job network.
