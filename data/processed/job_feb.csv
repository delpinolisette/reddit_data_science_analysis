Phone Interview: ""What payment compensation do you want to receive while working here?"" | Me: ""I would like to be compensated fairly based off my responsibilities, what do you suggest?"" ""Well our range is $___ to $___""",1186,f7ipxg,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f7ipxg/thanks_rjobs_im_surprised_this_actually_worked/,74,"Just got off my first phone interview that I've had in a while, and since I'm not too bothered by whether or not I get this specific job, I decided to try some things I had learned from reading posts on here for the last 2 years.

During my phone interview, the ""What do you want to be payed"" question came up. I said as corporate-y and HR-y as possible ""Well, I would like to be compensated fairly for the work that I do, and at this stage of the interview process, I would not feel comfortable suggesting an amount without knowing my full responsibilities. Given my skill set, what do you feel is fair compensation for me working this role?""

They slightly changed their response but essentially repeated themselves again. I did the same and repeated myself again.

Boom. ""For this role our range is ____ to ____ annually. Where do you think you and your skill set fall into this?""

Holy cow I've never tried to do that and I've never seen it work. Assuming I make it through to the next portion of interviews, I will definitely be doing that from here on.

Thank you r/jobs for teaching me how to negotiate.

If there's anything you would suggest I should do differently, suggest away. I'm always looking to learn and improve.

198,198,Finally offered a job after using this sub & 134 job applications later...here's what I learned.,682,faglop,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/faglop/finally_offered_a_job_after_using_this_sub_134/,91,"Foll^(About me: turning 27 this year; I live in South FL; market - environmental (not many opps, very lucky I snagged what I snagged. Went from doing Corps work (americorps & peace corps - 19k in THREE years to making 50k). Still in government.)

**Resume format:** 1 page. I followed the advice from r/resumes of writing ""Selected Experience"". I think this allowed recruiters & hiring managers to assume that I had more experience, but I CHOSE what to share with them.  I brought copies of my two page resume (edited the bullets to fit whatever job it was for) to the actual interview, along with supplemental materials. Do this in a way that shows your aptitude but doesn't give away your work ;)

`NOTE - I did not usually submit my 2pager. I BROUGHT IT WITH ME to the interview and said, ""here's my full work/volunteer history for future reference."" This provides them with the opportunity to look it over and have more of an idea of what I've done.`

I also gained traction when I used my bulleted cover letter.

**During the job search:**

* Create an excel sheet of the jobs you've applied to & contact information. Following up got me 6 interviews. I believe it helps to make sure a person sees your resume/application. I followed up with a brief email (1-2 weeks after applying) and attached my resume and cover letter (addressed to the person I followed-up with)!  Not everyone will reply, but some will :)
* Always follow up in the morning. Dont' get lost in their inbox (6 am - 11 am)
* Apply to the most interesting positions in the morning (if you can) / when you're not all checked out. Save the ""moderately/least interested"" jobs for later.

**Job interview prep: I found myself getting so worked up about knowing a good amount of the company that I'd lose focus on being myself and natural. I interviewed best (& received other offers) when I didn't focus too much** ***on them***\*\*. I also noticed that trying to have planned responses would choke me up because I'd be so focused on trying to fit them into the interview even when they didn't really answer their questions.\*\* ***Take a moment to pause and think about their questions!! REMEMBER, you already have the answers!!!***

*Print out the job description & write where you performed that task next to each bullet. This helped me visualize that I can do the job and have experience in whatever it is.*

**During the job interview:**

* A confident handshake (more important than you think), **good posture**, dress as best as you, arrive 30-40 min early (I spent about 15-20 min in my car - reviewing notes/observing people) this helped me realize - **everyone is just a person**.
* Ask questions during the interview and this allowed it to seem more like a conversation. Don't be afraid to chime in. Strategically.
* ASK FOR BUSINESS CARDS. This makes it easier to send thank you emails. As soon as you get to your car, write one thing down about each person on the back of their card.
* I have a nice leather folder that I put resumes in. Even if I didn't hand them a copy of my resume, I feel like it can add a nice touch.

**Common job interview questions included:**

* tell me about yourself (80/90% professional / 20,10% personal) - I think having a great  answer to this sets the tone and interest levels.
* what would you bring to this role/why you/what do you know about this company?
* weakness or something you should work on? Avoid the ""I'm too hard on myself"" BS answers
* what would you do during your first few months?
* where do you see yourself in x years/what are your career  goals?

Some of you may object to this. BUT if you have time, I say apply to positions you're pretty sure you can receive an interview for. The practice helps. Practice. I had a few fillers and I got better and better at interviews as time went on.

**Do you have any questions/end of interview:** Remember, you're interviewing them too. I think this shows your confidence and self-worth. Ask thoughtful questions. Ask questions that aren't so overused. They're probably interviewing a handful of people and this is your chance to shine. Don't bore them. Ask thoughtful questions that show your genuine interest in the position.

**Post-interview:** send a thank you note. concise & personable.

**The ""SECOND"" INTERVIEW/waiting game:** I grew frustrated with having weird waiting gaps in between and feeling like I could miss out on an opportunity if I took another one too quickly (while waiting to hear back). I scheduled my second interviews around the same week as one another.

**INDEED:** didn't apply much through there. I checked the org website itself and applied through it. I only applied using indeed for stuff i felt ""meh"" about. Apply through the org website. Especially if the position really interests you.

**RANDOM TIPS:**

* **Proof read your resume, make sure your dates are aligned, and no awkward white spaces**
* have a generic cover letter to just attach. No sense on wasting time if the position doesn't jump out @ you. But at least have something to attach. This sometimes gets you beyond the HR person. I've heard they'll sometimes automatically toss an application without a cover letter.
* Always have a pen.
* Brush your tongue (hate to be the one laughing with white stuff all over your tongue). When waiting, try to use the nearest bathroom. This will eliminate the chances of you having to go during the interview. Look in the mirror, superhero stance, and tell yourself  ""I got this!""
* SET JOB ALERTS. I applied as soon as one opened and they interviewed me while it was STILL POSTED. APPLY EARLY (imo, 15-20 days or less from the initial posting.)
* If you're unemployed - look for PT or volunteer work while you job search.
* Make sure your resume is quantified and states your accomplishments vs responsibilities - very important.
* If offered a position and you're waiting to hear back from another one. Try to ask them if you can be sent an explanation of potential benefits and have 3-5 days to think things over. This will buy yourself time. In the meantime, follow-up with other positions.
* Go with your gut when turning down positions. It came down to a 34k vs 50k job. The 50k job doesn't have a ""warm NGO vibe"", but I've done the ""warm NGO vibe"" for too long and need $.
* Pros and cons list of jobs. Commute, pay, benefits, people, work atmosphere.
* Keep up with current events (outside of the company) but within your industry. It'll make you feel as if you know what's going on!
* Exercise (if you can). Read. Pick up a hobby. When you tell them about yourself you wanna come off as passionate about what you do in your free time.
* Mix up your job boards. Staring at Indeed too long gets lame.
* Follow up 1-2 weeks after submission: I lurk the company's website. If I don't see HR, I take a guess and send  it to someone in the dept./area that I'm applying to. Some people are  kind enough to tell me they'll forward my materials and some of the emails went unanswered; whatever. **TIP: send it someone who isn't too high up to ignore it and  not too low that they're ignored, LOL**
* For jobs you REALLY care about, copy and paste / save it to your computer. Nothing worse than getting a call and not having the damn description.

224,224,My 16-month job search has come to an end,643,f5djl2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f5djl2/my_16month_job_search_has_come_to_an_end/,123,"It’s been an incredibly challenging road, but I’m happy to say that I finally found the right fit. Everyone’s journey is unique but I would say I was pickier than the average job-seeker and not sending out as many applications as I could, due to a few factors I won’t get into. I’m really honored to share what I’ve learned with you all.

**Not-so-impressive Stats:**
16 months of job searching
~ 50 tailored resumes
Dozens more applications with a one-size-fits-all resume
3 full-time offers (two were only a few months into my search, but weren’t a good fit for a few reasons)
1 accepted

**Biggest Mistakes:**

- Bad cover letters: At the beginning of my job search, my cover letters were way too long and just a regurgitation of my resume. Stick to two qualities you want to highlight using details that aren’t in your resume. In the salutation, address the hiring manager if possible, or even the Chief People Officer if you can’t find that info.
- Being underwhelming in phone screens. For a while, I thought my qualifications spoke for themselves and I just had to be polite to get past the phone screen. It wasn’t until a fellow Redditor told me that your elevator pitch sets the tone for the conversation. And it did!

**Biggest surprise:**
A couple months into my search I hired a career coach who opened my eyes to Applicant Tracking Systems. She helped me reformat my resume, deleting invisible tables, then adding summaries, quantitative results and a second page. I fed my resume into an ATS software multiple times before submitting it to a job. Ironically, this format led to zero in-person interviews and zero job offers, even after I tried to condense it to one page. Eventually, I met up with a recruiter who has worked for a few billion-dollar companies. She helped me shred my resume to the point where it didn’t even have enough words to register in the ATS software program. I actually felt MORE confident about my qualifications when my resume had about a third of the word count than my ATS-optimized versions. I received an offer from the first place I used this new resume. (It wasn’t magic—the role also happened to be a great fit.)

**Here’s what I would pass on to the other job-seeking Redditors:**

- If you don’t already know: write a cover letter (under 300 words) whenever there’s an option to; always send a thank-you email within 24 hours of an interview/phone screen; be gracious, even in the face of rejection; always ask thoughtful questions
- Act as though your job search will last for a year. I saved all of my notes from interviews and tried to recall the questions I was asked for future reference. All of my resumes, job descriptions, and cover letters are in Google Docs in a folder I hope I don’t have to look at again for a long, long time.
- Practice with a buddy and/or record yourself. Recording my elevator pitch helped me work on my cadence, duration, and to sound more natural. In a practice interview with a friend, she told me I rocked when I spoke when I thought I was leaning for emphasis. Yikes!
- Compensation: If asked, respond, “It’s too early for me to say, but I’m curious what is budgeted for the role.” That worked every time 100% of the time. When you get the offer, ask if the number they offer is flexible, then (without countering) ask for a day or two to consider the whole compensation package. Other things you can negotiate to get to your value: vacation, flex time, commuter benefits, job title, plan for rapid advancement, employee development.

**My interview and phone screen prep:**

- Research the company. If you’re proud of your LinkedIn profile, creep on your interviewer on LinkedIn. They might creep you back and like what they see.
- Highlight the areas of the job description you are uniquely qualified for and write down how.
- Outline your elevator pitch as it pertains to this role.
- Write down your three strengths and weaknesses (including how you’re working to overcome them). I never got asked these outright, but it was good to prime myself with this info.
- Google some common behavioral questions for the role/department.
- Know why you want THIS job: tie your strengths to what you want to be doing in your career, and how it matches the role or the company.

To all you job-seekers, you WILL find the right fit. And while you’re not actively scrolling or applying, try to relax and enjoy your open schedule. It really helped my stress levels when I realized that even if the job I had applied to that day was “the one,” it would be weeks or months before I would have started. This realization stemmed the persistent voice in my head telling me how badly I needed a job. 

I hope this is helpful to at least some people. Good luck out there!

336,336,You should stop participating in Indeed’s online assessments: and here’s why.,518,f9xgar,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f9xgar/you_should_stop_participating_in_indeeds_online/,121,"Let’s talk about Indeed Assessments.

Over my time of applying for jobs in the past, I have done a few of these so called assessments from Indeed. Personally, I will no longer be doing these, and neither should you. Here’s why. 

The job market is tough enough as it is and people who are applying to jobs day in and day out don’t need to waste anymore of their time. 

If the employer doesn’t see enough value in the applicant’s resume and experience (which also holds their contact information) and decides to automate one of the most important areas of researching job candidates, then that indicates to the job applicant that his/her respective company is a waste of time. 

It’s yet another way of attempting to get something for nothing by companies, which is the only thing that businesses revolve around these days. 

Indeed Assessments are gimmicks used by companies who are not capable of making job hiring decisions based on qualifications and interpersonal communication. 

People are more than happy to answer questions over the phone, in person, or email IF  the employer is willing to invest their time.

E: Can’t forget about the companies wanting you to film yourself answering useless questions and sending the video to them as part of an “interview” (thx to the people in the comments for reminding me)",1582769562.0,2020-02-26 21:12:42,February

Feel free to ask them for advice.",464,f3j0uy,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f3j0uy/just_a_reminder_job_recruiters_want_you_to_get/,89,"This is only for third party recruiters. Some large companies have recruiters in house, and I'm not talking about that situation.

First of all, recruiters are legit. I thought maybe they were scams since someone contacting me for a job sounded too good to be true. That was a long time ago, and I've dealt with them a lot since then.

A recruiter's performance, and sometimes even pay, is largely dependent on them placing people in jobs. If you get the job, that's good for them as well.

I see questions on here all the time about interacting with recruiters. I'll drop a few notes I've heard/experienced directly from recruiters, but would love to hear other thoughts, and let me know if I'm wrong on any of this.

Ask recruiters about the hiring manager/position/what they're looking for. They'll be likely to give you some good details because as stated above, they're rooting for you. They've also possibly interacted with the hiring manager and have some details that aren't on the application. They might let you know really great details in your history you should mention in an interview.

Feel free to ask about pay. I hated bringing this up in an interview, but a recruiter won't mind. Also this could stop you from undervaluing the position when asked what you want to be paid. Also ask them any details you think might be deal breakers. No reason to spend a bunch of interviews not realizing you're gonna hate a job.

Recruiters are less likely to turn you down for something very minor. They may leave some things out speaking to the recruiter or even critique you.

Once you are out, they won't be afraid to let you know. A couple times I've just been ghosted, but feel free to ask where you are in the process. (again no recruiter is gonna throw you out as a candidate cause you emailed them one too many times)

If you don't want the job, tell them straight up. I don't know why but I used to be nervous about saying this like I was breaking up with someone. They don't want to waste time with someone not interested, so it's no big deal.

Try to keep in touch with them. Add them in LinkedIn or something. I've had them call me back a month later asking if I was still looking.

That's all I can think of.

EDIT: since this is in contest mode, I'm going to put the most common/best comments here since they won't rise to the top. The things I missed on are basically the negative, which exist. I think this is partially because recruiters for someone with 6 years+ experience is different from someone with very little experience.

A lot of recruiters don't look to far into candidates before reaching out. This means they'll contact you with jobs you'd clearly have no interest. Another reason to ask questions (salary) immediately

""They dont want you to get THE job they want you to get A job"" most probably don't care whether it's a good fit on either side which is why you should immediately start asking questions.

They will ghost you. Some (once you've got more experience I'd say) will want to keep in touch cause maybe they'll try again with you later. For some, once you're out of contention, you're useless to them, and they don't seemingly care about their reputation. I've even had an appointment set up and been ""stood up"" (only once)

There are absolutely bad experiences but... it's job hunting. This sub is incredibly negative, and it's hard to blame, BECAUSE job hunting sucks. I'd still say it's slightly less awful than other ways of job hunting.

I am not talking about staffing agencies. Those are totally different, have their uses, but also downsides.",1581665409.0,2020-02-14 02:30:09,February

What can I do to help?",448,eyveg2,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/eyveg2/my_mother_has_asked_me_to_help_her_find_a_job_she/,157,"My mom came to America in the 80s after escaping a war-torn 3rd world country.

She also is, by definition, ""fluent"" in English, she just has trouble with the bigger words and complex ideas and sentence structures. I brought that up because I was expecting many to suggest a call center job, and I don't think that would be a good fit for her unless she works on her speaking abilities.

She is coming over on Sunday and I am going to explain to her that her job at Home Depot is currently a good set-up, and I will suggest if she wants better hours/pay/environment to look into similar stores (Lowes, Costco, maybe Whole Foods, etc.)

On top of that I will ask her more specifically about her history with programs such as MedicAid, human services, free community college classes (I know she took some before I was born in the early 90's), library classes, etc. Then I'll explain to her that if she wants a less straining job such as a call center or something with more computer work, that she will need to put the time into training herself to get better at her English and computer skills, and we will look into getting those resources together.

Y'all, I'm so excited and I want this job. It's also significantly the shortest commute I will have had in more than 5 years. Quality of life is important, so I'm taking that heavily into consideration with regard to pay.

This whole time I've been job hunting, I used an ATS tool to tailor my resume for each job ([Jobscan.com](https://Jobscan.com), which is free through my unemployment office and offers 5 free scans per month). I also used [JobHero.com](https://JobHero.com) to research potential achievement statements, based on real resumes submitted to their system. And I wrote thoughtful cover letters. I started out super nervous at interviews and after a few unsuccessful ones I got more comfortable. My unemployment benefits run out in about 3 weeks, so I was starting to get truly anxious.

About two weeks ago, I decided to try something different, so I took a bunch of assessments on Indeed and started applying to any reasonable job with an ""Instant apply"" option. I used to get a response for a phone screen or an in-person interview about once a month (once every 20-60 submissions), and since I changed my strategy I got 4 invitations in about a week and a half. I've probably applied to 20-30 jobs using Instant Apply. I went on 3 interviews this week (and there's one next week that I mentioned earlier)

Basically, what I've learned is that one strategy may not work the best for everyone. Once I started getting good results from Instant Apply, I decided to do that some of the time while dedicating myself to tailoring resumes and writing cover letters the rest of the time. This new technique might have worked for me because I've been working for 13 years and already have lots of keywords in my resume just by the nature of my career trajectory. Who knows. Maybe nobody is using Indeed assessments. I also linked some writing samples as ""publications"" on the site.

At today's interview I also shared a copy of my most recent performance review, which was super positive. (Not sure if its weird to do that, but it felt like it could help.)

This post is mostly a brag, but I also wanted to share some tips and also share how unemployment and job hunting are HARD. It's so easy to lose confidence and feel desperate. I've racked up a small credit card debt and gone full weirdo hermit mode and back again.

If anyone has tips on negotiating in my situation, criticisms of my techniques, or tips for others to get out of long-term joblessness, please feel free to share. And thanks for being an awesome resource during these dark months.

Update: they responded to my counter offer and have agreed to meet my salary expectation.",1581146100.0,2020-02-08 02:15:00,February

The HR screener got defensive and said I went back too far and that I shouldn't take reviews seriously from bitter ex employees anyway.  LOL I wasn't really looking to be scolded and lectured by an HR screener I was simply asking a question.  Needless to say I never got a call back after that for an interview with the hiring manager even though he had my resume and told HR to set up the phone screen to start.  So I am pretty sure they thought I was ""negative"" for bringing up the reviews and wouldn't be a good fit. 

Any opinions on this?  I don't think it's out of line to inquire about a pattern of negative reviews, but maybe this isn't a good idea, idk....",1582529656.0,2020-02-24 02:34:16,February

So today I got the confirmation that they are having talks about laying me off and starting a new team from scratch, without me. I'm very grateful that I got a heads up and I started applying elsewhere but how do you get over the shame of being fired? of not being good at a job that I love?

I keep seeing my coworkers evolve, achieve milestones and get promotions and being good at what they do and I just feel so ashamed. I can't deal with this reality. I'm overwhelmed with the anxiety of not knowing what awaits me in the future.

Very quickly, I found out that I am NOT a good fit for the company's culture. There have been a number of situations within my team that have made me cringe/angry/feel uncomfortable.   


1. My director who I report to is the CEO's daughter and only comes in to the office once a week and is not available via email or won't reply during the week.
2. In a meeting, the director and another senior employer laughed about women mourning a miscarriage and said it wasn't a big deal.
3. My team (about 10 people) openly discussed another team member's sexuality and questioned it without that person being present. 
4. I asked if I could take an early lunch one day so that I could check in on my dog who was staying at the vet following a minor operation and the director asked if my dog ""was always going to be an issue"" 
5. My friend who passed my CV along for this job now makes passive aggressive comments when she sees me outside work or hears about me travelling on weekends. She works 7 days a week and will often visit the office on weekends to do overtime - she wonders why I don't. 
6. Another member of the team pulled me aside last week and said, btw - you always take an hour lunch instead of the allowed 30 minutes and everyone is starting to question where you go... so you should stop that. I was never told lunch was 30 minutes and assumed it was 1 hour as we work 45 hours a week.   


Now, some friends have told me to just suck it up and this is what corp life can be like... but I have seriously come to dread waking up to go into the office. Would it be so wrong to leave?",1581291224.0,2020-02-09 18:33:44,February

I'm giving up.",305,f40cn0,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/f40cn0/ecology_bachelors_is_worthless_go_for_it_or/,142,"First and probably last time poster needing to let off some steam, so just hear a millenial out please. Or if you're some butterfly effect godsend and can give me advice, oh gods, Please, PLEASE.

So I did my bachelor's in ecology in a fairly good university (Tartu, Estonia). I'm in my first year of an ecoinnovation master's, but took academic leave because I need an income reallllllllly badly. I've been casually keeping an eye out for jobs (both within the EU and in my country) for years now, and it's always been pretty bad for non-IT aligned folks here, but now it's just a job drought.

Most jobs relating to life sciences in any way seem to require either a master's, driver's license (which I don't have), or previous experience. I'm surprised, because it shouldn't be too hard to train an employee in lab-specific equipment or programs (what some uni courses do during master's).

I'm fully fluent in English (even in my field), so I figured I'd search in say, Sweden, where my partner lives, or in other EU countries, but it's only PhD candidate positions, postdocs' jobs, and positions that require a third language I don't speak.

I'm broke and probably going to feel the pangs of hunger and homelessness this year, but I don't need advice to stop eating avocado toast. I'm just wondering - do my brethren in fields of ecology/biodiversity have it as bad? If so, how are you surviving and where do you work?

Got a temp offer at a zoo I'm considering, but after taxes my expenses would leave me in the negatives. Guess it's better than being in worse negatives though.

If you got wisdom or offers or pro tips or hints, please help a peep out via PM. Just please say nothing if you're from outside the EU. I don't want to hear ""six figure salary"" ever in my life ever again, as the local average is about gotdang 14k EUR a year.",1581749644.0,2020-02-15 01:54:04,February

The FC pretty much made questions like ""the previous interviewer made some pretty damnable feedback against you"", or ""you did poorly on the tests we set against you""

""We need people who can communicate with the other departments, you seem socially challenged"" 

Hell, she even said ""I don't know, but I feel like you are downplaying your strength, you need to sell yourself more"" and not even 10minutes later, ""I can sense cockiness in you, as if you think you're better than you actually are""

Honestly I'm just pretty confused about the whole thing.
