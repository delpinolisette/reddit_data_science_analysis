2,2,"Anyone else graduated, got in a 'career' and realise there was more to life than work?",1147,gh3k6s,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gh3k6s/anyone_else_graduated_got_in_a_career_and_realise/,233,"It's probably the number 1 thing driving me into depression. I can't come to terms with the fact that as I'm coming to 30, never have I felt more certain that the idea of a 'career' or working for the rest of my life in some repetitive job just to support my housing, family and retirement, is just NO life.

I'm not sure if it's bad experiences, or not knowing what exactly it is I want to do. Heck, I'm being paid 55k, but have already decided I will resign before the end of the year, leave London, and move back to my hometown (where opportunities are limited). This is simply because, after several years of slaving it out in an office, I so desperately miss feeling PURPOSE in life. Whether that's living under mum's roof and feeling the love of living with my family, being at University, and being surrounded by some of the best friends and richest experiences, being young and adventurous, traveling. Living life. 

Ever since I graduated and got into the 'workforce', aka, sitting at my corporate desk all day every day, life has been a misery. Eeach and every day typically morphs into the same scenario, wake up early, feel tired, commute, spend x hours under intense stress, commute home, change, cook, wash dishes, maybe go gym, bed, repeat. Then the weekend. Even weekends are duller than they used to be because people are so busy or spend time with their other halves or whatever else.

I came to realise through a lot of self-reflection during lockdown, that it's not the job, or the industry (I changed industry to mix it up and try something new). I realised that selling all of my time just to receive a paycheck, is nonsense. To the point where I'd rather resign and be unemployed whilst preparing for long-term travelling. It's strange because I want someone to tell me I'm barking mad, to leave a nice paid 55k job in the city for what I want - but you can't help what you feel. I'd imagine it's like a gay person and bottling up their feelings and then eventually coming out. For me, the truest thing I feel in my heart is that I just don't want to work 9-5 for the rest of my life, full stop. I want more out of life than living for the weekend, than defining my life and value by my 'work'. I can't derive value from anything else because I spend 80% of my waking time at work/commuting. No job has ever brought me any sense of purpose in life. It just draws me down further, gradually.

I just think it's an incredble shame, that we spend our lives in the pursuit of careers, selling our health, our time, our relationships and everything else just to put money in the bank and jump on the old societal bandwagon of buying a house and settling down. I thought after going into uni and then into the exciting world of financial services, that I had life set. But suddenly, I could not want it less. Even the idea of spending 30 years paying off a mortgage disinterests me. I find it a grim and miserable idea. What's wrong with me? But scarily, there's no viable alternative. It seems though a lot of people around my age who think similarly travel, so that's what I'm considering also.

Any others feel the same way?",1589153554.0,2020-05-10 19:32:34,May

For context, I work in advertising in New York. 

I’ve been in this industry about three years and I’ve basically learned there’s no place for people who want to show up every day and do their job because work is a necessity and you have to do what you have to do in life but without letting it consume you. Everywhere I’ve worked my employer seems to feel like it’s reasonable to expect the entire workforce to be hyper-career oriented, workaholic, type A people who don’t value anything in life higher than their job.

It’s not enough to do your job because it’s your job, you have to keep a facade of passion and believing in the company’s mission and shit and this is 100% expected to be your entire life. Imperfection equates to total failure and being a “pretty good” employee gets you fired.

I’ve just gotten a new job that I really want to do well at, but this disdain for work is deeply affecting my work and my enthusiasm for the role. I’ve worked part-time jobs and they weren’t so bad, but something about every 9-5 office job just feels like signing up for your own death. Like this desk, or another one, will be where I sit till I die. 

I resent it so much. I resent that our society is built this way, I resent that I have to spend my days doing this when I don’t enjoy it, I resent that lucky people like Kylie Jenner can sit at their gorgeous pools in the sun and play on their phones all day. 

I know I sound childish. I know this is just how it is. I’ve literally paid for school with the intent of having an office job. What do I do? How do I stop thinking this way and just accept that this is life? How do I start feeling enthusiasm and excitement for this role, especially now that I’ve just started at a new office?

I hate working remotely. I can't focus, I hate having to stay in my house all day, I hate the lack of social interactions (despite being a socially anxious introvert), and I feel like I am missing out on a lot of perks.

Where I work, they have a lot of free food around the office, which had allowed me to save A TON of money on groceries when I was working there as an intern, and now I don't have access to that anymore. I was relying on onboarding to make new friends outside my department, but I doubt it'll be happening now. How are you supposed to make friends on Zoom and Slack?

Everyone else seems to love it, but I need the structure of an office. I'm *less* productive when I'm at home and I actually don't mind a commute. It allows me to separate home life from work life. When I'm working from home, those lines become blurred. That, combined with the fact that I end up having to work longer hours because of my lack of productivity, makes me feel like I'm always at work.

Well $NastyCoworker didn't like the changes at all. Started up on a soap box about how she is never listened to and how I wasted all this time on changes that she didn't want. Basically saying openly in a meeting that I am incompetent. My boss basically tiptoed around her the entire meeting and once we got done with the meeting I called him directly and he agreed that she was off her rocker and I had made changes she wanted.

Since working from home my professional and personal productivity has skyrocketed.

This time has opened my eyes and I cannot go back to spending 40 in an office. I have no desire to do it. Prior to this covid crisis, the company reserved remote work for employees who had been w/the company 10+ years. It’s a family owned business and even one of the family members who had been there only a few years wasn’t allowed to work from home.

He wasn’t able to provide any information about where the company was at on the next reopening phase for us, but he seemed to understand. And I know many other colleagues feel like I do. 

My question is this:  is there anything I can do to move the needle on this? At this point it feels incredibly important for me to advocate for my needs.

I’ll try to summarize this, but I work in a high commission recruiting firm - placements typically earn you anywhere from $3,000-$12,000 Net commission - with that obviously comes a relatively low base salary. ($31,200 for the year)

I don’t want to do anything dumb because I’m new to my career and just graduated last May from college - but I quit my previous position at a 50k base to come here because the long term commission structure was so much higher.

Brief edit - the other recruiter works remote, there was no way to tell this candidate was spoken to because he didn’t follow policy.

 Me and a fellow co worker had spoken to a candidate however he had spoken to him a few hours prior and put him in for the position - however the employee did not follow any of the company policies. 

For anyone who has recruited you understand that the tracking system for candidates is huge to protect people’s work, I had actually qualified the candidate, gotten his updated resume, verified him, and added him to the system with him in my name and added notes. While the other worker briefly spoke to him, submitted him with an incorrect resume and was off the phone in 2 minutes. our company policy strictly states this means that it would go into my name because I had him in the database. because the other recruiter ignored all of this and the candidate had both of us submit him to the job (candidates can be sneaky like that sometimes)

Long story short the guy got the job and I’m looking at a $8500 commission minimum - but the owner is saying he might give it to the other employee because they’re friends and he’s been there for a while. The lead recruiter (my direct boss) is telling me how it’s not fair and if I wasn’t new then it would of at least been split 50-50. 

These placements take months to make, and I took a massive pay decrease to come to this company for this reason of high commission trades - but all my work is being stolen essentially in this instance, and I’m about to move closer to work in the next month or two so I don’t want to commit to a company if this is something which is going to constantly happen. 

Just want to hear your opinion on this because it’s going to bother me long terms and I genuinely cannot live off this base salary and dealing with student loans / rent at the same time when I can get a job with a 25-35% higher base salary in two weeks. My boss constantly is impressed with how hard I work and had fired 5 of the 11 recruiters in the office during the corona situation but kept me even though I was the newest - he texts me often to show his appreciation for my work and how it’ll all pay off soon - but then he goes and does this, it’s just hard to think past that.",1588453192.0,2020-05-02 16:59:52,May

Because of this I am panicking a little because of the lack of immediate fires to put out. And knowing that other people have massive new fires I was trying to streamline some of our processes to make life easier for others, but I may have frustrated them more. 

I feel guilty for still having my job. I feel guilty for not having a bunch of new responsibilities (yet).

I feel pretty hurt that they didn’t consider me back - kinda feels like they just wanted to get rid of me, and found an excuse. I excelled at my accounting job, and looks like the other ppl who got furloughed were all notably incompetent ppl. 

I need advice... should I reach out to the cfo who promised me the job and ask what’s up? Or should I let it go and wait/start looking for another job?

Feeling kinda hopeless, got any advice for me?",235,gtdk8j,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/gtdk8j/35yo_with_weird_life_trajectory_trying_to_get_a/,34,"I started freelance editing/proofreading about 10 years ago and stuck with it until now due to various family/health issues that prevented me from taking up a 9-5 job. I have 2 incomplete degrees that I abandoned years ago because I didn't need them for freelancing (MA about 90% completed, BA about 50%). 

Now I need a way to support myself and I'm trying to finally set up something that will work for me in the long run. My freelancer profile is probably my best asset with a 100% client satisfaction score and some great written feedback. I never knew it would be so useless when trying to find employment. 

The thing is, I want to quit freelancing. For me, it's always been too much effort for an unbalanced work life and little money. I definitely never enjoyed the constant race for new clients either. Some of this is probably my fault.

I also want to step away from editing. I'm a decent editor, but not some great talent, and I no longer enjoy doing it. This is partly because of the nature of freelancing and partly because I find most of my projects unfulfilling and meaningless. I did have some good, long-term clients, but not enough to be able to refuse crappy ones.

My aim is to establish a simple, ""normal"" adult life with a job that pays the bills and has fixed work hours. At this point, I don't even care if it's boring, I just want to be financially balanced, not having to work (chase new clients) to be able to work, and have a couple of hours to myself after I've finished work.

But I'm not sure it's possible to make this transition without solid work experience and education on my resume. I'm worried that I'm too old, my work experience is not enough, and generally not sure how to go about it. 

Do you have any advice for me? Courses I should take that would make me marketable in a short period of time?

I'm actually not some lowlife, I just need someone to give me a break. I work hard, learn fast, and I'm responsible. I've always worked remotely and would like to keep it that way. I was looking at jobs like content moderation and customer support roles where they don't necessarily ask for relevant experience. But there might be other options, I just really never learned how to do a proper job search. Any advice is appreciated!

When I first decided to switch to marketing (bc I couldn’t find any decent paying jobs in graphic design in my area) I took a job in marketing at a small (but had a huge client list across the country) business that promise I would be working & gaining experience in marketing. They wanted someone fresh because they never really had a designated marketing person and it would be a great growing experience for both of us. They were the ones who got me back in school for marketing. I stayed there a little over 3 years and ended up only really ever doing graphic design with minimal raises, barely any marketing experience, and no promotions. I eventually left that company when they opened a new position in marketing & never considered me for the position (even though this would have been GREAT marketing experience for me and i expressed interest in the position) to give it to someone outside the company that eventually came out she had no idea what she was doing. 

I had another dumb job that didn’t even last a year and now I’m at my current job.

My husband stuggled through college, but he made it, graduated with a BS in Mechanical Engineering. The problem was his final GPA was a 2.5 (lots of events happened that lead to the final number. No excuses being made here though).

No entry level mechanical engineering jobs would even interview him, siting his GPA was too low. Fast forward a few years and he’s had a job as a auto cad drafter & auto cad tech. We thought, ok he has some job experience, let’s try applying to low level jobs at the engineering firms. Maybe now the GPA won’t be an issue.

He applied to a hiring event at an engineering firm. His sister knew the guy running the event, he spoke with him before the event and heard they were desperate to get people in. He wasn’t even allowed into the hiring event because his GPA is a mandatory field and they automatically kick out anything lower than a 3.0.

Does this mean his GPA will always keep him from becoming a mechanical engineer? How do you get a foot in the door to even be interviewed if places don’t even look at your experience because of GPA? Should he be thinking of a new career path?

I studied advertising and journalism with plans to be a copywriter, and I realized it’s not the path for me. I worked really hard in my classes, interned at a major ad agency, pulled all nighters for my school’s ad competition, and read every copywriting book I could get my hands on. By the time I graduated in 2016, I had no desire to work in the industry. I’ve been trying to figure things out since. I’ve jumped around from different jobs and plans, and now I’m unemployed and living at home. I’ve become pretty depressed because I always took pride in my drive.

I don’t want to rant *too* much about what I dislike about copywriting because I’m trying to move forward. I learned a lot about myself in college, became more introverted, and I don’t feel like I value anything about the ad industry. For example: I don’t care about trends / social media / ads in general. I value people who are genuine and don’t like the culture of selling and people pleasing. I tried to suck it up because I know this is a privileged ‘problem’ to have, but it’s hard to pretend, especially in an industry where there are so many passionate people trying to break in.

Anyways, I’m looking for ideas or suggestions on what I could do next and how I can use my time now. I consider myself a creative, but I’ve developed a lot of non-work related hobbies and passions and don’t feel the need for my job to be that ‘cool.’ I think some variety would be nice, though. I’m hoping to find something with decent pay and more stability than the more creative routes I’ve considered (freelance writing, photography, etc).

Some background info and ideas:

* Since graduating: I worked at a restaurant while getting an ESL certification and student teaching, but my plans to teach abroad fell through. Then I worked as a writer at a very tiny marketing firm for a year and a half. I moved to NY and have lived off of temp agency work and sporadic freelance writing and photo assisting. I was interested in learning about becoming a photographer (I’ve had some photos published in magazines), but ultimately there isn’t enough stability and too heavy of a barrier of entry for me.
* I feel ‘unmotivated,’ but there are a lot of things I am interested in (work and non-work related). I’m really interested in people/ethnography, language, visuals / art / design / clothes, psychology, music, and nature / conservation. Obviously no job will encompass all of these things, but it’s a start.
* This isn’t a priority, but I’d like to be in a less conservative work environment if possible. I am a photographer and artist and like a lot of esoteric music and film. It would be great to not feel like I’m hiding at work.
* I’ve got job ideas related to my interests but most of them don’t seem that viable, especially now. I care about money and stability more than I did before, and I’d rather pursue freelance writing and photo projects outside of work.
* I’ve been interested in and looking into tech / coding related jobs, but I feel like this has become a go-to for people not knowing what they want to do. Is this worth looking into? Is it realistic to start learning now and find a job soon?
* I've been working on side projects to keep some motivation. I'm working on a website / social account with a friend right now highlighting style and aesthetics in jazz. I'm working on a long-term photo project, making playlists and a fake ""radio station,"" and hoping to take some drawing and French classes for fun.

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this. I need to figure something out soon since I lose my health insurance in the next couple months, but I’m trying to break this pattern of lulling around. Any ideas, suggestions, reality checks, etc are welcome!

I know I'm not willing to walk away from the opportunity, but given how expensive my area is, I feel like I should at least try to get more. When I negotiate, should I raise them to 60k/61k or something like that and ask if we can meet in the middle? Or should I just ask for the straight 58K? Given that it's a federal contracting company, my instincts tell me they have a very rigid pay structure and that they truly would not be able to go above 58k.

Revision1: Thank you everyone for the advice, I'm glad to hear about many different possible career routes and I'm grateful for everyone who opens my mind to the possibility of another opportunity!",1589075303.0,2020-05-09 21:48:23,May

Lately I have been on unemployment and I have to say it has really drained my motivation.  Ive fallen into a slump right after getting my Masters degree, partly because after applying widely I have had no luck.   


I spent the last year driving for uber and I found that it was good soul searching experience.  I found out 2 things about myself.    


1.  I love motivating and inspiring others.  The best times I had as a driver were when I was able to motivate an inspire younger underprivlages high school kids.  Weather that's talking about college, or encouraging them to deliver pizza instead of dope.  It really made me feel good and  I was good at it.    


2. Theres nothing like working for yourself.  I ended up putting a lot more hours into work because I was not working for anyone else.    


So my masters degree is in health science.  I wish I could get into a counciling or therapist role with that, but I can not.  Also, I do not have an undergrad degree.. I went to grad school in my jr. year.  Also.. my masters is from a Caribbean school.  So far nobody has given me any grief about where it is from, but I do think I will run into problems applying for masters programs here in the US. 

I would love to be a psychologist.. but I feel like I might be too late.  Im really good at fixing things, I have really good clinical knowledge and knowledge of anatomy, physiology, biochemistry, pathology and other medicine related subjects.  I have good computer skills, good leadership skills, good customer service skills, good math skills and can be extremely hard working.  


I live in Seattle right now and while on unemployment I have been spending my time teaching myself SQL.  Its slow going, and I don't even know if I can get a job afterwards.  The other Idea I have is to use my uber income and save up and get a food truck.  Seattle has a big hole for late night food.  hope u have a good day, thanks.",1590415903.0,2020-05-25 10:11:43,May
692,692,Reposting because it didn't gain a lot of traction: I'm 19 and am in a pickle between school and the military. What do I do?,124,grox8f,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/grox8f/reposting_because_it_didnt_gain_a_lot_of_traction/,137,"So I am currently 19 years old taking summer courses at my local community college after my 1st year at my actual university. After the 2nd summer session (ends about mid-July), I will have 45 credits completed. I am set on enlisting (not going officer) into the Air Force but do not know whether I should do it now (after summer courses are finished), or when I graduate. The tough thing about this situation is that I set myself up to graduate college in 3 years instead of 4 (2022 instead of 2023). The other tough part is regarding the money that the Air Force allocates per year ($4,500) so that would limit the amount of courses I could take along with having to work my job on base.

Having said that, I am having a really difficult time deciding whether I want to stay in school for the next 2 years and enlist after or enlist now and finish school while I am in. I am just barely leaning towards finishing school so that I can work on my doctoral degree while I'm in but, as stated above, this is a really difficult decision for me. I would love any advice from anyone out there. Thank you for taking your time to read this!",1590631706.0,2020-05-27 22:08:26,May

I'm a sophomore in college majoring in Global Studies and Economics with a concentration in Middle Eastern Conflict and Security with plans to go to graduate school 2-3 years after undergrad. Quarantine has given me a lot of time for existential crises, mainly about my future and career paths I could take. I'm one of those people who's interested in everything (travel, politics, history, creative writing, problem-solving), yet not sure how to make a successful and interesting career out of those interests. I'm also simultaneously worried about being a corporate sell-out and not being viewed as traditionally successful by not going down the consulting/Wall Street path that many intelligent college students are drawn to for the money and immediate prestige.

**I want you to tell me about the jobs that you have found fulfilling and (if you're willing) how you got to your position. It also doesn't have to be a ""cool"" job; if you're a consultant or a Wall Street analyst or a have a corporate job and love it, I want to hear why.**

And the job opportunity and pay for kin is laughable. 

So I need advice on what career I should look into that I can learn relatively quickly to pay off my loan on a useless degree. I was thinking about learning code-getting into the computer field,  or go into a skilled labour trade. 

At the end of the day I love the health care field and helping people. I plan on going back to health care once I get my financial situation managed.

873,873,Recent college graduate with degree in biology. Discovered I hate academia and grad school isn’t for me. Go back to school for a trade? Push through with career using B.S. degree? Just look for advice please!!,89,grch6d,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/grch6d/recent_college_graduate_with_degree_in_biology/,88,"Recent college graduate with biology degree. Not sure where to go, especially in these weird times.

So I have a biology degree with a focus in ecology and conservation. I’ve had numerous internships and some research experience. I found in the past four years of university that I despise academia, so going back for grad school won’t be happening any time soon if I want to keep my head on straight. 

Personally, I feel the urge to go to community college and get a trade certificate...maybe I’m ungrateful for my degree, but I simply can’t see how I am marketable in the work force with the degree I have. I have learned that I’m a very hands on person, which is why I’m leaning towards learning a skilled trade.

On the other hand, I’ve also had an interest in GIS, so I could easily get a certificate in GIS which would pair nicely with my current degree. However, I have become quite opposed to desk work in the past year. 

All in all, I feel quite silly for the degree I got and further confused because I’m a much different person than I was when I started school in terms of work ethic...maybe I’m not different, but I certainly have learned more about who I am and what I think I desire out of life.

Thanks for simply reading through this little rant. Feel free to ask questions if you’d like to hear more about my situation/if you feel I’ve left anything out. 

TLDR: Want a hands on career. Not a desk job. Am I acting childish, or should I go back and get schooled in a trade?",1590581205.0,2020-05-27 08:06:45,May

When I started I was super excited about it and was raring to go. Slowly over time I realized why the position I am currently in opened up. Employees keep leaving, at least one every month. The company is not big by any means, around 35 employees. There is a general unhappiness, anxiety, overworked, understaffed air about the place and this was even before COVID-19.

The pandemic has of course made things worse. Our salaries have been cut, which is understandable considering the situation but our clients have also lost some of their ability to pay us while we still bust our asses for them. This is what our boss expects, a lot of work and less pay. We have been told we should be grateful we still have jobs, in not as nice terms.

I'm privileged enough to be in a situation where I don't have kids, I'm not married, do not have a mortgage to pay or even rent. I wake up every day dreading work and wondering what is keeping me here. I'm normally not the sort of person who gets anxious easily but it's been through the roof lately. 

I wonder if I should cut my losses and leave now before this ship fully sinks or wait to see if things improve.",1589384168.0,2020-05-13 11:36:08,May

Now, I think I've found that UI/UX design could be on the right track, since I have some design experience and my degree is related.
