Meanwhile, I'm still in the interview process for my dream job. It's a 24-month apprenticeship program with a full-fleshed training program, including course materials, a mentor, etc. (not to mention with a very reputable firm).

Thank you to everyone who took the time and even calculated detailed expenses and wrote elaborate responses. I will try to respond to everyone as soon as I can. I genuinely appreciate all the support. I know we're all a bunch of random people on the internet but I wish you all the best. Some of these responses gave me the boost I needed. 


I recently accepted an offer for this $17 hourly paid call center job because I had bills I needed to start paying after being unemployed for a year. I was very anxious to start doing anything and unemployment really took a toll on my mental health and self confidence. I understand my market is currently struggling and I shouldn’t feel this way. 

My previous role (which I really liked) was a technical business analyst role (60k salary + benefits) which I secured after graduating with my Bachelors and had a lot more responsibility than my role now. That BA role went through a restructure and I was fired after my boss quit.  For this new call center role, I have been here a month and I already feel like I don’t belong. I would like to be here no longer than 6 months while I look else where. I’m also fairly burned out from the job search and trying to find ways to network instead to blindly submitting applications.

My primary concern is the effect my coworkers will have on my outlook when networking with others. It seems judgemental but everyone here is severely financially irresponsible and not in a place that I would like to be in emotionally, health-wise and psychologically. For example, there’s been comments made about how micromanagement is not a big deal and you should expect to hear from your manager if you’re a minute late back from 30 min lunch. At the same time, it’s nice to have somebody to talk to after being unemployed.

I’m also concerned with losing a 1.58 PTO monthly accrual to interviews. How do I filter interviews?

Did I mention that I have to drive 72 miles one way to work this job? With bills, I’m barely able to scratch even so this job is definitely not sustainable.

On a positive note, my shift starts at 10AM so at least I have time in the morning to interview and get things done.

I feel trapped. What is the smartest thing I can do to get out of this job into a more sustainable situation? How can I explain to recruiter or future HR why I’m leaving a job after being fired from one? Any similar stories or situations I can have for encouragement for any advice is sincerely appreciated.",1583216363.0,2020-03-03 01:19:23,March

I was having issues with my alarm not going off/sleeping through them the last couple weeks, but I was late becaise of it about 3 times in 3 weeks. And. Part of me yes, recognizes why I was fired I get it. The other part of me is...kind of hurt? I got along with my boss well. I actually really liked my job. I'd been there for a about a year. And my boss wasnt very strict as far as attendance and the late policies. She'd let several instances for my other coworkers slide before. Me being late wasn't a chronic thing. It literally just started the last couple of weeks. (God knows why, I sure as hell don't.) And the hurt part of me is from my boss just. Firing me. Without asking me about why my being late started. And yes, I know we're adults, and this is a professional environment, but she extended that courtesy to my other coworkers before as well. But with me, there was nothing?

I guess for the most part I'm just writing this to vent/process everything. I honestly have no idea what to do going forward. This is my first time being fired. I don't know how to explain why I was late in interviews, without either being blantantly honest or just straight up lying? How do I even handle this?

I interviewed for a job this past Tuesday. Shortly after, I emailed my interviewers, including the hiring manager, to thank them for their time. On Wednesday, I received an email (directed to me) from the hiring manager that said I was being offered the position—I was so excited! I emailed back immediately to let them know I accepted their offer and I even received a response saying they were ""happy"" to have me ""on board."" 

However, today I got a voicemail/email saying that I was offered the position by accident, that it was an email/working-from-home ""glitch."" I'm absolutely stunned and devasted. 

Here is the email I received:

""Hi \_\_\_\_,

I am back in the office today and just left you a message.  I made a huge error in saying we've offered you the position. Working from home, I had computer glitches and made an error. Given that I do want to let you know you're high on our list, but still waiting to hear back from everyone on the team about ranking.  I am deeply sorry for this mistake and hope you understand. Please call me if you have any questions.""

Like I said, I'm stunned and so, so sad about this. Any tips for how I should respond? I can't think clearly right now and I've never experienced anything like this before. I'm a grad student (graduating in May) and was so stoked to know what my next steps are. Is this worth complaining to their HR manager about?

Thank you in advance.

TL;DR: I was accidentally emailed the job offer; it was meant for someone else.",1585375732.0,2020-03-28 02:08:52,March
699,699,The main difference between my good and bad interviews,334,fdmaxq,jobs,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/fdmaxq/the_main_difference_between_my_good_and_bad/,33,"I just got off the phone with a recruiter that told me I was the best candidate she'd spoken to. The recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn with a position and no company, and I found the company name by searching her job description and matching it to a listing. It turned out to be a company using really cool technology that matched my background and interests. She said that the knowledge I had made the interview easier for her and that I sounded like a nice person to work with.

I realized that the main difference between my good and bad to average interviews was how genuinely excited I was about the company. I have a hard time faking interest in a company with an unexciting product or core values that don't match mine. I think it's worthwhile to frame your company research around finding something about them that piques your interest and that would make you excited to work there. 

When the company's work is meaningful to me, I:

\- ease my anxiety about trying to land the job

\- have the peace of mind that I am being honest and not trying to be anyone else

\- present myself as personable and friendly instead of robotic

\- am eager to share about myself as much as I am eager to ask questions

\- have an easier time presenting myself as a good candidate overall",1583394967.0,2020-03-05 02:56:07,March
