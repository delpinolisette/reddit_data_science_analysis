1,1,Are you seriously trying to quit your job during a global pandemic and impending recession? o_O,1250,g4d70n,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g4d70n/are_you_seriously_trying_to_quit_your_job_during/,188,"This will probably be downvoted to hell. That’s okay. 

But really, there has been an uptick in people posting about quitting their jobs. This isn’t to berate you. If you aren’t happy, you really should find a way to leave. Your mental health and professional fulfilment is much MUCH more important in the long run. 

HOWEVER, if you know that you don’t have a fat kitty saved up or a wealthy family to fall back on- please don’t make the jump just yet! The same goes for those in jobs with an easier ‘replacement index’ or ‘entry bar’ (cringe). Don’t do it!

Think long and hard. Where I am, the depression from the lockdown retrenchments alone has led to a rise in suicides. Quitting your job and then finding yourself in the cold may put you in a worse off position.

This is sounding harsh but it is coming from a good place. Things are going to work out. We just don’t know when. In the meantime, hang in there. Take this global lockdown time to plan your exit meticulously, save up and start skilling up for the jump. 

Good luck!",1587351475.0,2020-04-19 22:57:55,April

57,57,My company keeps forcing everyone to do social activities on webcam as a means of overcompensating for the fact that we're working from home. I'm really not a fan of this. What should I do?,447,g59s3o,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g59s3o/my_company_keeps_forcing_everyone_to_do_social/,72,"I'm really not a fan of forced socialization (especially when it's organized ""team activities""), mainly because the type of work I do at my company (and in general) is very solitary and when I have a lot on my plate, I have always seen zero benefit in having to step away from my work and socialize in a way that doesn't feel natural for me.

Right now, my company is obviously working at home because of COVID. When I found out that we'd be working from home for an extended period of time, I was honestly really happy. As someone whose job requires a lot of focus and solitude, I really thrive when I'm just by myself and can zone in on my work without distractions. However, management keeps speaking to our company like they are worried about us all being shut-in and not being in the office. We're now forced to have some meetings every day (over Zoom), that we otherwise have once or twice a week in the office (for a couple of them, it's starting to seem like people don't know what to talk about). In addition to this, management keeps planning all of these ""social"" activities over Zoom that they aren't making voluntary.

I'm the only person who has my role at my company and we've taken a hard hit because of COVID. As such, I've actually had a huge increase in my workload since this has happened, which I've tried desperately to stay on top of. I won't lie - this situation has caused me to feel extremely burnt out and stressed as I'm trying my best to cope with everything. I feel like my main duty is to do my job and stay on top of it, and having to keep breaking my focus is making this so much tougher. I just want to be at home and focus on my work so I can get through this, and all of this forced social crap is infuriating.

I don't want to say something that will get me into any trouble, but I also don't understand why they are ""forcing"" these activities and not sort of advertising them for people to do if they wish/if they have spare time. Especially during a time where everyone is being put under stress and not everyone will be dealing with it in the same way. What should I do? Should I say anything to my manager or just stay quiet?",1587477739.0,2020-04-21 10:02:19,April

So please help me out. 

I babysit for this family. They have a 3 year old who I love to death. I've known the mom ever since I was little because my parents are friends with hers. The mom is 23 now. She WAS a single parent when she first needed me to babysit back in September. And now she is married. They are both cops that work in the jails. 

When she first needed me she was a single mom and I told her to pay me as much as she could and she told me she could only do $25 a day (she only needs me Saturday and sunday). So I was okay with it because that's all she could afford. I originally would start at 12:45 PM and go till 9:30 -10 pm and then she started to need me earlier. From 12:45, 12:30, 12:00, 11:30 am, 11am, and sometimes to 10am.

She ended up getting more serious with her boyfriend and he moved in so I ended up getting off around 7 PM. Now they're married so they have two incomes coming in. Their schedules got changed so now they both work from 5:30 am to 2pm, so they need me to come over at 4:45am till 3 PM. 

I did the math for how much im getting paid by the hour and it's around $2.72. I live with my boyfriend now, and with the whole coronavirus this is my only source of income since the other family I baby sat for doesn't need me any more.  I'm not sure if I should tell her I need to be getting paid more and I'm not sure how to tell her especially because when I needed to be paid in advance she did that for me and gave me $150. I ended up almost working all the days off for it, but she recently just told me that she decided to forget about it and started paying me again, so now I'd feel bad If I told her I need to be paid more

Several of my community’s workers - CNAs, private duty aides, and food service workers all interacted with the patient in the time after she returned but before she was confirmed to have Covid19.

What are some good ideas to consider moving forward?",332,fuwy9w,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fuwy9w/ive_been_unhappy_with_my_job_for_a_while_and_was/,41,"I’m sure I’m one of MANY people posting about this same problem, so I’ll first just apologize about this in advance. I’ll also preface this post by saying that I know I’m fortunate to not be out of work right now.

I’ve been pretty unhappy with my job for some time now, and right around this time was when I was planning to look for another one (ironically, I had gone on a trip before COVID-19 broke out and my plan was to do this after I got back home). In summary, here are the reasons why:

* Long hours, understaffing and me agreeing to way too much in the past year has led to me wearing far too many hats. I’m burnt out, never able to complete everything each week and management is aware, but doesn’t seem to do anything about it.
* My role has changed from one where I was supposed to be a creative contributor to my company to one where I just manage and oversee logistics all day. It wasn’t what I signed up to do and I don’t even get to do any of the responsibilities I was originally given when I started (which was work I actually enjoyed, is in line with my skill set and that was valuable for both the company and my resume). Duties that were once mine are now just outsourced by third parties and managed by me. It's definitely not the same thing as what I joined to do, at all.
* Management knows I want to go back to my original duties and have repeatedly told me they will do this for me and reevaluate processes, only to then keep roping me into the very duties (mentioned above) that keep me from doing just that and doing absolutely nothing they promise.
* Management is young, inexperienced and not good at fixing problems when they’re brought to attention. This results in me and other colleagues getting the brunt of other people’s problems.
* According to market trends (at least before COVID), I was being underpaid and overworked for this role. I’m not sure if this still stands now.

Overall, I’ve been unhappy for quite some time now and I don’t feel like this job is at all aligned with my career goals at all. I’ve managed to keep my job and work from home during the pandemic, which makes me feel like an even bigger POS for complaining. But with that being said, I can tell that taking our company online is already starting to worsen the lack of organization and alignment. On top of stress over what’s happening in the world right now, I know my mental health is not in great shape dealing with this role. Even prior to this, I was dealing with working late hours, extreme burnout and lack of sleep. I still want to make the best of my life and my career during this time and I know I’m not doing it here.

With all this being said, I am perfectly happy with working from home (I'm a bit of an introvert and actually fare really well with it) and the type of work I do is very easy to do remotely. Is it worth the risk to still look for something else right now or am I making a bad move? I’d love to know if anyone else has greater insight on the remote market right now or what that’s looking like. It's been over a year since I've looked for a job and I've never looked for a wholly remote opportunity before.",1586047825.0,2020-04-04 20:50:25,April
147,147,"Is it worth it to leave a high paying job that makes me miserable, for one that pays less but doesn't make me cry daily?",311,g6dwc8,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g6dwc8/is_it_worth_it_to_leave_a_high_paying_job_that/,71,"&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I work in the hospital lab in a very specialized position. Specialized to a point there are only 1500 of us in the country roughly. One of the bigger cons of this is I can't just go work somewhere else. If I had a family that lived here and something happened or I quit, I can't go to the town over or down the road, I would have to move hours away for another job. I feel like I am forever at the mercy of my employer.

&#x200B;

I got into 4 different masters programs when I finished college. I did so many different jobs, trying to find the one that felt right. My mom has always been money minded, so when I got into my graduate program with the expectation of making 75k+ a year, she was thrilled and pushed me to do it. I was excited, and this program had a higher salary and a higher liklihood of employment (though limited, they don't tell you that part). I started med school not fully knowing what it was, but got through everything just fine with great grades. During rotation year I remember thinking ""Is this what I want to do for the next 30 years of my life?""

&#x200B;

I started working at my current job a year ago. Two months in, I was already uncomfortable. The healthcare field is viscious, and our leaders in my group are as well. Since I've started I have seen the revoling door of employment, and have seen 8 people come and go since my first day, only 8 months ago. When I started, I was making 75k, and as a new graduate with more loans than that number I was happy. But as time went on, I became a wreck. My ex left me for a week because I would just come home and cry. I was miserable. I've applied to other places, but it's so specialized and so few positions anywhere even remotely close that I am SOL most of the time. I wondered why the people I worked under during rotations seemed so burnt out and miserable, saying the spark will go away fast, and now I know. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today. Recently it's gotten worse. Everybody's pay got cut at least 20-25%. My hours got increased, and I'm doing 55 hours a week now. I am constantly walking on eggshells waiting to get in trouble for sneezing when I should have coughed, knowing if even a whiff of something not perfect gets out that I will be absolutely fired. 

&#x200B;

Besides the employer issues, this job may physically be killing me. I'm pretty certain I will have a stroke by 40 with all this stress. Once I'm off work, I can't relax. On top of that, my back is constantly hurting, and that's just how it is and nothing can fix or prevent that. This job is also just relatively dangerous, and I've already gotten pneumonia and TB from patients before. 

&#x200B;

My passion is dead. It was short lived, it existed momentarily, but it's dead.

&#x200B;

I told my mom months ago I wasn't a fan, she told me it's just a phase. I told her in winter, again, suck it up you don't mean it. Now that the world is falling apart and the hospital is running itself and employers into the ground, I told her again that I'm not in love with this job. It makes good money, but I'm not happy. I can't have a family or relationship and feel happy knowing 1/3 of my day is spent in nonstop worry and anxiety. I told her I want to look elsewhere for other jobs, and she said I am being dramatic and need to stop, they put themselves on the line to hire a younger person, I have debt this is what being an adult is I need to suck it up, and this is just a rough patch. She's mainly concerned with the money I make, and it always. comes. down. to. the. money. At this point, making less than 50k terrifies me because of how she has made me feel over the years. 

&#x200B;

I have been searching for jobs, and i can find other ones in other fields. I would be making above 50k, but not as much as I am now. I feel like I failed though. I got into my program, I was the head of the student side of things, I was the first to get a job, I graduated, I got my license. I did it, and I don't want to do it forever. I genuinely feel like I am doing something wrong, or I'm a bad person, for feeling this way. I want anything else, literally anything else.

Hi all,

For context: I'm a final year university student who will hopefully be 'graduating' this summer. I'm also currently applying for jobs, which is obviously not ideal in this climate.

I'm not dealing very well mental health wise with the current lockdown. I've got a few final university assignments to do, which I'm struggling to get done, but other than that I don't feel at all able to do... almost anything else. I'm seeking help etc. (I'll save you all the long details!), but I'm barely fulfilling the basic functions of a human being at the moment, let alone learning new skills, taking online courses, or generally working on my personal or professional development.

I'm worried that, over the coming months/year(s) I'm going to be asked about how I used this period to improve myself and make myself a better candidate, and that I'm not really going to be able to say anything. I can say that I was working on my university work, and that I've done a little bit of aid volunteering (it's an ad hoc kind of thing), but I reckon that lots of people feel more able to use this time to do lots of impressive stuff. That's how it feels among my peer group, anyway. I was already less than confident about getting a job after I graduated, but it would really suck if this was another blow.

I know that many of you are currently seeking employment/might work in recruitment etc., so I was just wondering what your thoughts were. Let me know if this is the wrong sub!

Thanks :)

Disclaimer: I fully realise that people have *far* *far* bigger problems to face, and that I'm in a pretty fortunate position.

—————
I just started a new job a couple of months ago and I’m having a hard time fitting in. It’s my first job out of school in a large company in the Midwest (USA) and I moved here from a North Carolina suburb. I am one of the youngest here. 

I’m a very outgoing person and was very excited to come to this position. I love learning about new people as well. I met with all kinds of people, introduced myself, asked them tons of questions, and tried my best to start conversations. 

But that’s not reciprocated. I often don’t get told good morning (I get no one OWES me this but it’s a bummer), I get ignored in meetings, and no one wants to hold a conversation with me about even the most mundane things. My emails get ignored sometimes too even by those within my function. For the email thing, I probably need to earn my place or something, but it’s compounded by all the other things I’ve been experiencing. 

A couple of examples:

My function had a group call and I asked them what they’ve had for breakfast just to fill the pre-meeting silence and got nothing back. Another person came on and they were willing to talk to them about their mundane question. So I didn’t bother saying anything else and it has made me stop going into meetings too early. 

I went to a team building lunch and no one spoke to me despite me asking them questions about themselves and trying to connect on what they’re talking about. At a table of four, I sat with two other new people and one seasoned employee. One new person asked everyone but me what brought them to the company. I asked her but no one reciprocated. Things like that happened throughout the lunch. I just stopped talking.

It’s honestly made me withdraw into myself and kind of killed my desire to be outgoing. I feel very alone and that no one really wants me there or wants to get to know me. I just sit in these meetings, introduce myself and people say “hi” and nothing else. So I’ve kind of stopped trying.

I know it’s important to be strong and hold out, especially in new positions, but I thrive off of team work and some sort of camraderie. 

It’s probably hard to gauge just from a post on reddit but any suggestions on how I can connect with my team and business partners? What sort of things am I doing wrong? What can I do to improve? Maybe I’m just reading into it incorrectly. I don’t know. I honestly feel like maybe the Midwest isn’t for me...",1586990970.0,2020-04-15 18:49:30,April

I was relieved about this as my current employer has been really good to me throughout this whole isolation process and I didn’t want to have to resign during this time.

I received a call today to say that I basically had the position (pending reference checks) as the CEO of their company called off the recruitment freeze. 

I’m super happy about this as it’s exactly what I wanted before isolation began - the role is way more pay, in an industry im passionate about and close to home - but now I’m in an awkward position where I’m probably going to have to resign via email or zoom from my current employer. 

I’m having a lot of anxiety about resigning due to the fact my current employer has treated me really well, they’ve ensured my job security throughout lockdown and also it’s a ‘cushy’ job. 

But I also really want this other position and I won’t be able to wait it out until the end of lockdown to take it as I doubt it would still be available.

What is the best way for me to approach this?

I’m 32 and had a stroke November last year, which took away my speech. I had to relearn how to speak starting with the abc. Today marks five months since my stoke and I have recovered roughly 75%. I still find it difficult to get out some complex words, joining words (like ‘and’ and ‘an’), and my sentences sometimes have slight gaps between words. Sometimes I speak perfectly, but I’m slower than I once was but I’m getting there! They say it’s takes several months to a year to heal the brain after a stoke. I’m have youth on my side. 

Before I had my stroke, I was travelling the world for six months. I got made redundant in March 2019 from my finance role, where I analysed companies (shares) and the economy for a living for six years writing a newsletter for a global publishing company. All up I have roughly 7-8 year experience in the financial industry. But I wasn’t able to break into a big fund or broking firm, so I was severely underpaid (~$80k) by industry standards of $150k+. But I have the interesting and competitive experience for finance, I guess.

My concern is that I have over a years gap on my CV....now with the corona virus and businesses not advertising for jobs. Then again, if this event didn’t happen, I still wouldn’t feel ready because of my speech - it will be hard to sell myself now. I’m thinking of giving myself until the end of the year to hopefully recover, and, by then hopefully the economy will be reopened and companies hiring again. 

To cut a long story short, I’ll probably be out of the work force for nearly 2 years because of my stroke and the economic shutdown before I apply to jobs...if I start applying at the start of next year. 

I have always wanted to give tech sales a crack, but that depends obviously on my speech and how much it recovers - I’ll need to sell myself to land a job and I can only do that if I’m 99% better. I feel hopeful about it though. But I don’t know what I will look like in 3-6 months. If not, I will probably go back into finance becuase I’ll have no choice. That said, I’m just concerned about my possible 2 year gap. 

Do you think I’m screwed and have anyone changed careers in their 30s, or got a professional job with a long gap on their CV?",1587256511.0,2020-04-18 20:35:11,April

Despite this, I've been repeatedly chewed out by my boss because the junior team members complete more of a few specific kind of tasks than I do in a shift.

To me this seems ridiculous. It's like asking a manager of a coffee shop why they aren't making as many cups of coffee as the baristas. During shifts I'm the sole go-to person for people from other departments (there's a lot of back and forth) and in charge of overseeing operations, and deciding which tasks are priorities and which aren't, and doing final QC checks. Even to get all of that done I usually end up working 10-12 hour days, and it's still not enough.

My boss just won't listen when I explain how overworked I am. He has very specific ideas about how long certain tasks ""should"" take, right down to the second. He's mapped out my shifts according to these increments of time that he's decided constitute how long each task should take and it all adds up to 8 hours, therefore he thinks there shouldn't be a problem. There's no accounting for the fact that switching tasks every few minutes makes a dent in focus and productivity.

For example, one of the tasks that he's tacked onto my job is running social media. I'm supposed to post to Twitter 30 times a day with accompanying images, gifs etc. and he says that this should be easy because ""it only takes a few seconds."" But crafting a tweet that's witty and engaging and corporate-friendly takes more than just a few seconds, and interrupting my day to do it 30 times is really disruptive.

With everything that I'm expected to do, mistakes are inevitably made and things slip through the cracks. I've been reprimanded for mistakes many times and every single time I tell him the same thing: I have too much stuff to do. And nothing changes. If anything, more work just gets added to the list.

I'm a 22 year old male from the USA about to graduate with a degree in Software Engineering (Computer Science) in 2021. I had an internship and honestly it was the perfect job for someone going into my field, it was fun, exciting, and hands on.

I just don't feel any type of reward from working hourly paid jobs, maybe because I don't feel the direct impact of what I am doing, plus I hate belonging to a big group.

I noticed I am much more productive when I'm not following other peoples orders. For example, over the breaks I would sometimes do unassigned projects on my own, then when the next semester would start a professor would assign something similar and I would end up procrastinating and barely submit it on time while I had already completed something similar. I also work as a freelance mobile mechanic and do heavy research on the vehicles that I fix and I have a lot of enjoyment working on their cars.

In my life I had worked 12 different jobs (construction, software internships, mechanic engineering internships, Retail, etc.) and I would always think cynical thoughts to cripple the companies.

I'm currently deciding whether to just graduate and finish my degree in Software Engineering, then apply for dental school and eventually open my own practice.

My dream in life is to work less than half the year in the States, and spend the rest of the year in a Latin American country with the money I saved up working in the USA. Basically make 40k in 6 months then live in Central America for the other 6 and repeat this process.

I can’t stand my boss, I think the brand I’m working for is toxic, for example we were forced to turn off reviews.

I really appreciate it. <3**

My BA (East Asian Language and Lit) has gotten me nowhere other than high-end retail, and at this point I feel like I need a graduate degree in order to progress. I certainly don't mind going back to school, but I'm not sure what I even want to do.

My top two choices are a) library science or b) forensic science.

Library science makes sense as it gels with my educational background and previous internship experience as a librarian and a teacher. The work would be easy, it'd be cheaper than other degrees, and it would only last two years. It's also an easy program to get into.

The problem is that I just don't... really... want to be a librarian. I don't feel any passion for librarianship. It feels like the easiest, most mundane choice I could possibly make, and I hate that. It would be stable. It would be smart. It would be very boring.

On the other hand, there's forensic science.

Pursuing forensic science wouldn't make sense, but it's my dream career. I am deeply fascinated by everything to do with forensic science and have been since I was a child. I read forensic news and research in my spare time (which I've had a lot of lately). However, it would be a complete 180 from any of the work I've done so far. I didn't take any STEM in college, I have no background in chemistry. Is this even plausible? Is there any way I could catch up??? I'm a quick learner and I absorb information fast; is there somewhere I could start?

These things might not even matter, however, as my choices are limited by my college transcript. To be blunt: it sucks. Nearly everything from freshman to junior year is a total garbage fire with a few Bs thrown in for variety. My main problem was that I was too busy sleeping and staring at walls to go to class; the second problem was the suicidal depression. When I did make it to class, I would sleep at my desk and take notes that were mostly nonsense scrawling.

Eventually I got diagnosed with narcolepsy, took a year off, came back a little more manageable. My senior year is all As. However, a college board probably isn't going to care about any of that. Any respectable program would take one look at my awful GPA and toss my application in the garbage. I also won't have any stellar letters of recommendation from professors, because, well, I was asleep, and a very bad student.

Sorry this is so disorganized. I don't know what to do or where to even begin. Which program should I choose? Should I even try???? Any advice is appreciated.",1588149647.0,2020-04-29 04:40:47,April

I have been diagnosed with ADHD by several different doctors, but my psychiatrist refuse to medicate or discuss other behavioral options with me because I don't think she believes the diagnosis/thinks I'm just ""on my phone too much""... So I've relied really strongly on the external structure of a workplace environment and co-workers around to keep me focused. Since that doesn't exist anymore, I'm falling apart. I'm making more mistakes, being less productive, pretty much a slew of fireable mistakes if I wasn't working in an industry that doesn't really fire people.

One of the leads I do occasional work for has always needled me, and I could probably write an entirely separate advice post about his other behavior towards me. However lately, he's started making jokes about my mistakes... Saying things like ""you messed up... again? :)"" on a daily basis. I can take a joke, but the same one made every day when I *am* trying to find ways to create structure and stay focused is really wearing on me. 

It's already upsetting to be letting people down constantly, I want to do a good job and it's humiliating. But the jabs are getting to me and obviously making it worse, as I'm posting on Reddit instead of working. How do I get him to stop?

However, I'm already beginning to feel as though I don't want to stay doing this forever, because I'm beginning to resent the fact that I never know when I'll be home, and I fear that there isn't much room for me to grow because I don't know if I'm ever going to be suited for a position where I am in charge of other people. I'm thinking of going back to school (I finished high school but that's it), partly to seek career growth but also because I feel I am bored and mentally understimulated. I'm not sure what to go back for though, and it's a difficult situation to try and go back because I need to work full time to support myself and my fiancee (her mental health struggles have been a barrier to her working up to this point, I am our sole income). I'd like to have a career that's more intellectually interesting, but I'd like a more stable schedule (roughly 40 hours most weeks, preferably). I have a bit of a STEM background from the advanced program I went through in high school, and think I might be interested in a career in biology or botany, but I am open to other fields of study, and I do enjoy being outdoors, but it seems that any outdoor job tends to have a more unpredictable schedule and/or less pay than I would prefer. What do y'all think, is it worth my while to explore other options, or should I just get over myself and stay where I'm at?

624,624,"What kind of jobs can you do from home, not having to interact with people, that pay at least $50,000 a year?",141,fxnv4k,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/fxnv4k/what_kind_of_jobs_can_you_do_from_home_not_having/,193,"I asked this in the jobs subreddit, and the mod removed it saying “No soliciting”, even though I’m not trying to sell anything, so, I guess I’ll post this here, since it’s essentially the same thing (career=job).

And preferably not require 8 hours a day, or 40 hours a week, but I wouldn’t be unwilling to spend that much time since the benefit would be getting to be at home by myself.

Disclaimer, I’m 24, but a social anomaly, and my family’s abuse and being financially unable to support myself makes me socially withdrawal even more.

I’m kind of relieved school has been moved online (because of the pandemic that mentioning gets people banned and demonetized in the case of YouTubers) because socially, I was getting nowhere.

I’m a college freshman at 24 years old, who sucks at driving (recently failed the test) and completely dependent on my parents to not be homeless. 

I couldn’t even get the pills I require to function on a basic level if it weren’t for being on my parent’s health insurance (I live in the United States, no Universal Healthcare here), which I will be legally forced off when I turn 26. If I lost access I could literally end up another crazy homeless person, and no offense to anyone (I know some really are just down on their luck) but I would rather kill myself than be homeless (also because I’ve already been abused and miserable my whole life)

I suffer from OCD, ADD, and more recently, severe anxiety, depression, and until my psychiatrist added another medication, near-violent rage (I can’t function at all without medication, and I’m still not a functional adult).

I hate my job, but I am very grateful to have it (especially throughout the whole pandemic, because many people have lost their jobs) and virtually always go in, no matter how bad I feel, because I know that being unemployed is 100x worse.

I literally just bag groceries, get grocery carts from a parking lot, and restock returned items. Sad part is, I started in a regular department, where I was even initially told that I was doing good, then that quickly turned into me being “too slow” and “missing too many details”.

I do not want any handouts, even if I am legally entitled, I’m already ashamed enough, and relying on others to survive is a TERRIBLE feeling, the fact that I rely on my own parents makes it somewhat more bearable, but I still get let know that I’m “past my time”, sure, I contribute to some things, but that’s such a small percentage of full living costs, my parents work very hard (I know life is hard, one of my biggest mistakes was growing up believing life was easy and just happened by itself).

I had internet friends, but withdrew myself because it felt pointless talking to people I’d never see. I also swore off LDRs, because I’d never get to see any of those girls/women in real life, even if I could, I can’t afford actual living costs, and even if she’s one of those women who takes care of her man (nothing wrong with that if it’s ok for a man to take care of a woman) I don’t want my livelihood dependent on anybody but myself.

If I have a girlfriend and we break up, I at least shouldn’t have to worry about being broke or homeless.

I’m willing to work, but it eats me up inside everyday, doing a job that nobody actually needs done (or at least takes virtually no skill to do whatsoever), having people treating me like I’m slow (stop calling me buddy unless you’re Canadian!) automatically seeing my job position, and feeling unworthy of any social interaction, if I befriended anyone, it wouldn’t be long before the questions start about my lifestyle, and I will be judged, negatively.

I have too many mental issues, emotional, even physical (some may or may not be caused from medication), and now I’m plagued with insecurity, and despite desperately wanting to break dependence on my family, lack of motivation to do anything.

OK, I do have motivation and interests, they’re just not very strong or consistent, nothing is really THAT INTERESTING, if it is, the interest won’t last long, until it’s just another memory that’s no longer associated with pleasure.

Other reasons working from home would be nice, more dependent on myself (well, if I’m self-employed, which would be true financial freedom, or at least as close to possible as it), less forced socializing means more energy, less anxiety (I’ve literally resisted a panic attack to run out of the building, although that was the first day of a job, and it was better as soon as the second day, although it was seasonal and they let me go after the season), and hell, this whole pandemic is reason enough to work from home if possible. 

I was never meant to be a social extrovert, if I can have any social and/or dating life, I don’t want it to be too much. 

It’s hard to feel any worth or value from doing work that you don’t feel purpose from, especially when you have nothing else, or nobody else, to live for outside of a job. 

Even if I don’t have to be a complete social hermit (I’ve come so close to becoming a complete misanthropist due to how I’m treated, and resisted falling into the cult of inceldom and misogyny, when I manage to avoid hatred, my perspective just leaves me with confusion) it’d still be nice to be able to work from home, and make not driving even easier (that’s caused so many issues for me, and I’ve spent so much on Uber and now risking catch the you know what, and some mentally unstable guy almost drove into incoming traffic with me as a rider!)

*Sigh*

Even when I’m told how much I’m appreciated and how good a job I do, I feel like worthless garbage, because that’s not a real accomplishment for somebody my age, I should have a REAL ADULT JOB and be living on my own, supporting myself.

I’m not worried about supporting a family (why the hell would I want to create kids against their will who could suffer just like I have? That’s assuming any woman even wanted to do that with me) but feel I need to make a lot of money just for myself, for freedom, because true freedom only exists with a lot of money. I’ve never felt free, yet my family claims that “Democrat socialists” will take our freedom away, especially because “socialism is the first step leading to communism”. 

Well ONE, I think America needs a better social safety net and PROGRESSION (we should strive to be like Denmark, the happiest nation on Earth, me may have a much bigger country, but we also have more wealth to cover it) and TWO, I’ve never felt freedom anyway.

The closest I ever got to freedom almost left me homeless, that hurt my sense of competence even more. Being told I’m stupid for trying doesn’t feel like freedom, and being stranded from running out of savings certainly doesn’t feel like freedom.

I was told to try and change my situation if I was so miserable, and when I tried just that, my family told me how wrong it was and that I needed to go back to sitting at home, and I ran out of savings from motel rooms and applying to basic jobs, ending up staying with other family and relying on government assistance just to eat!

I WANT MY OWN LIFE! AND I WANT TO PROVIDE IT FOR MYSELF! 

I am so different than most people, and it’s only getting worse....",1586445302.0,2020-04-09 11:15:02,April

Nevertheless, he has offered to be a strong reference for me, and I'm grateful that I have that support. I dwell and feel genuine regret over this anomalous incident, but I recognize that it's made me a better person.

Moving forward, my questions are:

* How transparent should I be to my professional network in regards to finding my next role? 
* What are recommended job search strategies, particularly during the pandemic?
* Tips on evading inquiries from ex-coworkers, family members, or friends  when it's still a sensitive matter for me to share?
* Should I be transparent to a recruiter when they ask why I left the organization or wait until the interview with the hiring manager?

I’ve been really depressed after graduating from UC San Diego last June 2019. It’s been months and months of constant rejection. I’ve only get offered jobs from minimum wage jobs such as Target. I graduated with a bachelors in science in public health. I’m starting to realize my degree gets me no where. However, a few of my peers with the same degree has found a job related to health. I also have been applying to internships, yet I never get called to set up an interview. I have previous work experience at an office and I have plenty of volunteer experience. None of these has led me to any job entry positions. Am I doing something wrong? Is it my Resume? The way I type information onto online applications. My lack of skills? My degree? I’m just deeply depressed and I even moved back home in Northern California with my parents and they’re financially supporting me. This makes me feel completely guilty as I’m the first to graduate and I can’t get a job anywhere. Not even the public health department at different state counties will offer me an interview.

I’ve been super down and all of that sadness comes from moving back home with my parents, not having any friends at my hometown, and no money.

987,987,My company is cutting salaries by 20%...but I can’t afford the pay cut. Is there a way to negotiate this diplomatically?,78,g6v3s6,careerguidance,https://www.reddit.com/r/careerguidance/comments/g6v3s6/my_company_is_cutting_salaries_by_20but_i_cant/,41,"I am a sr. associate level employee working for a small-ish company. A few weeks ago, it was mentioned that executives and director-level employees may be forced to take a pay cut to keep the company afloat. However, today it was announced that all employees will see a 20% pay cut starting in a few weeks.

I am currently one of the lowest paid employees in the company and absolutely will not be able to afford the cost of living in my area if my salary is reduced by 20%. I met with my boss to ask whether the exec team could consider a lower percentage cut (like 10 or 15%) for employees making below a certain salary/seniority level. The company is small, so there are only a handful of associate level employees to whom this exception would apply. He was pretty negative towards the idea saying that it’s “tough for everyone right now” and that it’s “only fair” for everyone to make the same sacrifice.

But the thing is... we’re not really all making the same sacrifice. While I am grateful to have a job during this situation, a 20% cut for my boss and other senior level employees is probably a “sacrifice.” On the other hand, a 20% reduction for those of us at the bottom is a make or break difference. Honestly, when the office reopens, Im not even sure if I’d be able to afford the cost of my commute anymore on this reduced salary. It would almost have been better to be laid off or furloughed because currently, unemployment pays more than my reduced salary, plus, I’d be eligible for other benefits, like food stamps and subsidized rent. At the very least, offering a reduction in hours along side the salary decrease would allow me the ability to take on a second job (if I can find one...)

My boss told me I could bring it up with HR, but that they “most likely won’t be receptive.” I understand that things are tough and I am willing to sacrifice in order to keep my job (such as giving up other benefits like the paid leave I’ve acquired) ... but I need to at least try to negotiate a better situation because, quite frankly, I can’t afford not to.

Is there a way for me to go about this diplomatically?",1587705298.0,2020-04-24 01:14:58,April
